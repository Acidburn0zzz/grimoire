GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for creating windows with
OpenGL contexts and receiving input and events. It is easy to integrate into
existing applications and does not lay claim to the main loop.

GLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, OS X and many
Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and FreeBSD.

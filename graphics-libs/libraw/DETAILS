LibRaw is a library for reading RAW files obtained from digital photo cameras 
(CRW/CR2, NEF, RAF, DNG, and others).
LibRaw is based on the source codes of the dcraw utility, where part of drawbacks 
have already been eliminated and part will be fixed in future. The users of the 
library are provided with API to be built into their software programs.

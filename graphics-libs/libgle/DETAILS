The GLE Tubing and Extrusion Library is a graphics application programming
interface (API). The library consists of a number of "C" language subroutines
for drawing tubing and extrusions. It is a very fast implementation of
these shapes, outperforming all other implementations, most by orders of
magnitude. The library is distributed in source code form, in a package that
includes documentation, a VRML proposal, Makefiles, and full source code and
header files. It uses the OpenGL (TM) programming API to perform the actual
drawing of the tubing and extrusions.

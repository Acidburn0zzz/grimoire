cat << EOF
libopenraw is an ongoing project to provide a free software implementation
for camera RAW files decoding. One of the main reason is that dcraw is not
suited for easy integration into applications, and there is a need for an
easy to use API to build free software digital image processing application.

It also has the goal to address missing feature from dcraw like meta-data
decoding and easy thumbnail extraction.

cat << EOF
The Puzzle library is designed to quickly find visually similar images
(GIF, PNG, JPG), even if they have been resized, recompressed, recolored,
or slightly modified. The library is lightweight yet very fast, configurable,
and easy to use, and was designed with security in mind. This is a C library,
but it also comes with a command-line tool and PHP bindings.

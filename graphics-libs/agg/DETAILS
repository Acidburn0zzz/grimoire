Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) is an Open Source, free of charge graphic library,
written in industrially standard C++. The terms and conditions of use AGG
are described on The License page. AGG doesn't depend on any graphic API or
technology. Basically, you can think of AGG as of a rendering engine that
produces pixel images in memory from some vectorial data. But of course,
AGG can do much more than that. The ideas and the philosophy of AGG are:

    * Anti-Aliasing.  * Subpixel Accuracy.  * The highest possible quality.
    * High performance.  * Platform independence and compatibility.  *
    Flexibility and extensibility.  * Lightweight design.  * Reliability
    and stability (including numerical stability).

Below there are some key features (but not all of them):

    * Rendering of arbitrary polygons with Anti-Aliasing and Subpixel
    Accuracy.  * Gradients and Gouraud Shading.  * Fast filtered image affine
    transformations, including many interpolation filters (bilinear, bicubic,
    spline16, spline36, sinc, Blackman).  * Strokes with different types of
    line joins and line caps.  * Dashed line generator.  * Markers, such as
    arrowheads/arrowtails.  * Fast vectorial polygon clipping to a rectangle.
    * Low-level clipping to multiple rectangular regions.  * Alpha-Masking.
    * A new, fast Anti-Alias line algorithm.  * Using arbitrary images as
    line patterns.  * Rendering in separate color channels.  * Perspective
    and bilinear transformations of vector and image data.  * Boolean polygon
    operations (and, or, xor, sub) based on Alan Murta's
      General Polygon Clipper.

Anti-Grain Geometry contains many interactive Demo exemples that are platform
independent too, and use a simple platform_support class that currently has
two implementations, for Win32 API and X11 (no Motiff, no other dependencies,
just basic X11). One of the examples is an SVG Viewer.

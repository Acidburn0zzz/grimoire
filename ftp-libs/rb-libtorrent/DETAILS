libtorrent is a C++ library that aims to be a good alternative to all the
other bittorrent implementations around. It is a library and not a full
featured client, although it comes with a working example client.

The main goals of libtorrent are:

    * to be cpu efficient 
    * to be memory efficient 
    * to be very easy to use

Egg is an Emacs interface to git. It's a suite composed of a minor-mode and
various special-buffers presenting different UIs to help the user performing
many git operations.

Provides a git-specific interface, for browsing and interactive manipulation
of history, comparing revisions, merging and rebasing, stashing, stagging,
ref creation and deletion, pushing and fetching, out-of-scope grepping,
and commiting.

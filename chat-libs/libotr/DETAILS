Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging allows you to have private conversations over
instant messaging by providing:

Encryption-No one else can read your instant messages.  Authentication-You are
assured the correspondent is who you think it is.  Deniability-The messages you
send do not have digital signatures that are checkable by a third party. Anyone
can forge messages after a conversation to make them look like they came
from you. However, during a conversation, your correspondent is assured the
messages he sees are authentic and unmodified.  Perfect forward secrecy-If
you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation is compromised.

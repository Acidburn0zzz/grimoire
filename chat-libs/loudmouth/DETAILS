Loudmouth is a lightweight and easy-to-use C library for programming with the
Jabber protocol. It's designed to be easy to get started with and yet extensible
to let you do anything the Jabber protocol allows.

Official loudmouth project is no more maintained - both
<http://projects.imendio.com/loudmouth> and
<http://loudmouth-project.org>.

This fork of loudmouth is lazily maintained by MCabber community.

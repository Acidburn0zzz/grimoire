cat << EOF
The heart of the Meanwhile Project is the Meanwhile library, providing the
basic Lotus Sametime session functionality along with the core services;
Presence Awareness, Instant Messaging, Multi-user Conferencing, Preferences
Storage, Identity Resolution, and File Transfer. This extensible client
interface allows additional services to be added to a session at runtime,
allowing for simple integration of future service handlers such as the user
directory and whiteboard and screen-sharing.

cat << EOF
Decibel is a realtime communications framework, meant to integrate services
like CTI (Computer Telephone Integration), VoIP (Voice over IP) and text
based chat. This integration makes it possible to uniformly manage user
settings across communication methods. Decibel further enables developers
to use these communications technologies more easily, allowing for improved
communications and - ultimately - collaboration features in their
applications.

Decibel consists of the desktop neutral policy daemon and desktop dependent
components. These components interact with the user and its desktop
environment by providing GUIs for common tasks like eg. creating a new
account, storing passwords or contacting a friend. Using the Telepathy
specification (http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/) the Decibel daemon
manages Telepathy compliant connection managers (implementing the various
communication protocols) and ties them together with Decibel's components
to form what a user perceives as one application.

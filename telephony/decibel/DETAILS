cat << EOF
Decibel is a realtime communications framework, meant to integrate services like CTI (Computer Telephone Integration), VoIP (Voice over IP) and text 
based chat. This integration makes it possible to uniformly manage user settings across communication methods. Decibel further enables developers to use 
these communications technologies more easily, allowing for improved communications and
 - ultimately - collaboration features in their applications.

Decibel consists of the desktop neutral policy daemon and desktop
dependent components. These components interact with the user and its 
desktop environment by providing GUIs for common tasks like eg. creating a new
account, storing passwords or contacting a friend. Using the Telepathy
specification (http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/) the Decibel daemon manages
Telepathy compliant connection managers (implementing the various 
communication protocols) and ties them together with Decibel's components to form what a
user perceives as one application.

Features:
Written in C
Implement the RFC3550 (RTP) with a easy to use API with high and low level access.
Includes support for multiples profiles, AV profile (RFC1890) being the one by 
default.
Includes a packet scheduler for synchronizing rtp recv and send. Scheduling is 
optionnal, rtp sessions can remain not scheduled.
Implements blocking and non blocking IO for RTP sessions.
Supports mutiplexing IO, so that hundreds of RTP sessions can be managed by a 
single thread.
Supports part of RFC2833 for telephone events over RTP.
The API is well documented using gtk-doc.

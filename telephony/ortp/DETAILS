Features:
- Written in C
- Implement the RFC3550 (RTP) with a easy to use API with high and low level
  access.
- Includes support for multiples profiles, AV profile (RFC1890) being the one
  by default.
- Includes a packet scheduler for synchronizing rtp recv and send. Scheduling
  is optionnal, rtp sessions can remain not scheduled.
- Implements blocking and non blocking IO for RTP sessions.

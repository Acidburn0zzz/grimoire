cat << EOF
Mission Control, or MC, is a Telepathy component providing a way for "end-user" 
applications to abstract some of the details of connection managers, to provide a 
simple way to manipulate a bunch of connection managers at once, and to remove the 
need to have in each program the account definitions and credentials.

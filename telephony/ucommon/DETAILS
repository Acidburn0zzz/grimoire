cat << EOF 
UCommon is meant as a very light-weight C++ library to facilitate using C++ design patterns 
even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for systems using uclibc along with posix 
threading support. For this reason, UCommon disables language features that consume memory or 
introduce runtime overhead, such as rtti and exception handling, and assumes one will mostly be 
linking applications with other pure C based libraries rather than using the overhead of the 
standard C++ library and other similar class frameworks.

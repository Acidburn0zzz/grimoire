Kamailio is an open source implementation of a SIP Signaling Server. SIP
is an open standard protocol specified by the IETF. The core specification
document is RFC3261.

The Kamailio SIP server is designed for scalability, targeting large
deployments (e.g. for IP telephony operators or carriers, which have a large
subscriber base or route a big volume of calls), but can be also used in
enterprises or for personal needs to provide VoIP, Instant Messaging and
Presence. Kamailio is well known for its flexibility, robustness, strong
security and the extensive number of features - for more information,

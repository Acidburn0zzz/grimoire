cat << EOF
GNU ccRTP is an implementation of RTP, the real-time transport protocol from the IETF (see 
RFC 3550, RFC 3551 and RFC 3555). ccRTP is a C++ library based on GNU Common C++ which 
provides a high performance, flexible and extensible standards-compliant RTP stack with full 
RTCP support. The design and implementation of ccRTP make it suitable for high capacity servers 
and gateways as well as personal client applications.

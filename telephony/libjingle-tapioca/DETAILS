libjingle is a collection of open-source C++ code and sample applications
that enables you to build a peer-to-peer application. The code handles
creating a network connection (through NAT and firewall devices, relay
servers, and proxies), negotiating session details (codecs, formats, etc.),
and exchanging data. It also provides helper tasks such as parsing XML, and
handling network proxies. You could build the following programs with
libjingle:

A multi-user voice chat application 
A multi-user video conferencing application 
A multi-user live music streaming application 
A peer-to-peer file sharing application

This is a stripped version created by the tapioca project

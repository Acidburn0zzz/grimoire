cat << EOF
Oscpack is simply a set of C++ classes for packing and unpacking OSC 
packets. Oscpack includes a minimal set of UDP networking classes for 
Windows and POSIX which are sufficient for writing many OSC applications 
and servers, but you are encouraged to use another networking framework 
if it better suits your needs. Oscpack is not an OSC application 
framework, it doesn't include infrastructure for constructing or routing 
OSC namespaces, just classes for easily constructing, sending, receiving 
and parsing OSC packets. The library should also be easy to use for 
other transport methods (eg serial).

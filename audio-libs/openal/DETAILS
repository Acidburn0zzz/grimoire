OpenAL, the Open Audio Library, is a joint effort to create an open,
vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
audio.  OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop
users that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other
multimedia applications.  OpenAL is already supported by a number of
hardware vendors and developers.

TSE3 is a powerful open source sequencer engine written in C++. It is a
'sequencer engine' because it provides the actual driving force elements of
a sequencer but provides no form of user interface. Sequencer applications
or multimedia presentation packages will incorporate the TSE3 libraries to
provide a user with MIDI sequencing facilities.

TSE3 is a mature library based on a lot of experience. Whilst not providing
the user interface, it provides a lot of assistance to a UI, attempting to
provide as much funcitonality as possible in as generic a manner as possible.

cat << EOF
SoundTouch is an open-source audio processing library for changing the
Tempo, Pitch and Playback Rates of audio streams or files:

* Tempo (time-stretch): Changes the sound to play at faster or slower speed
than original, without affecting the sound pitch.
* Pitch (key) : Changes the sound pitch or key, without affecting the sound
tempo or speed.
* Playback Rate : Changes both the sound tempo and pitch, as if an LP disc
was played at wrong RPM rate.

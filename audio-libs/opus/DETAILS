Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec. Opus is
unmatched for interactive speech and music transmission over the Internet, but
is also intended for storage and streaming applications. It is standardized by
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 6716 which incorporated
technology from Skype's SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.

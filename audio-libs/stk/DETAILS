The Synthesis ToolKit in C++ (STK) is a set of open source audio
signal processing and algorithmic synthesis classes written in the C++
programming language. STK was designed to facilitate rapid development
of music synthesis and audio processing software, with an emphasis on
cross-platform functionality, realtime control, ease of use, and educational
example code. The Synthesis ToolKit is extremely portable (it's mostly
platform-independent C and C++ code), and it's completely user-extensible
(all source included, no unusual libraries, and no hidden drivers). We like
to think that this increases the chances that our programs will still work
in another 5-10 years. In fact, the ToolKit has been working continuously
for nearly 15 years now. STK currently runs with realtime support (audio
and MIDI) on Linux, Macintosh OS X, and Windows computer platforms. Generic,
non-realtime support has been tested under NeXTStep, Sun, and other platforms
and should work with any standard C++ compiler.

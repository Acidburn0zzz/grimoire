cat << EOF
Kate is a codec for karaoke and text encapsulation for Ogg. Most of the time,
this would be multiplexed with audio/video to carry subtitles, song lyrics
(with or without karaoke data), etc, but it doesn't have to be. A possible
use of a lone Kate stream would be an e-book. Moreover, the motion feature
gives Kate a powerful means to describe arbitrary curves, so hand drawing
of shapes can be achieved. This was originally meant for karaoke use, but
can be used for any purpose. Motions can be attached to various semantics,
like position or color, so scrolling or fading text can be defined.

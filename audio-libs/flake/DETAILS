Flake is an alternative encoder implementation for the FLAC format.

There are both benefits and drawbacks: In its current state, it gives, on
average, slightly better compression than the FLAC reference encoder and
is about twice as fast. However, it does not currently implement all the
advanced features such as tagging, cuesheets, 24-bit audio, embedded pictures,
and ogg encapsulation. These features might be eventually added.

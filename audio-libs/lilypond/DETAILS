Computer printouts of sheet music usually look dull. LilyPond is different: 
it can make beautiful sheet music. Use it for your music too!
Scores made with computers almost always look bland and uninspiring, but 
for what reason? Machines may be mechanical, but why should their 
products be? With that thought in mind we started programming seven years 
ago. We have tried to capture the rules of good music engraving in a 
program, and that program is called LilyPond.  The best is that you 
can create beautiful sheet music comfortably with LilyPond.

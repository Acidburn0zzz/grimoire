aubio is a library for audio labelling. Its features include segmenting a
sound file before each of its attacks, performing pitch detection, tapping the
beat and producing midi streams from live audio. The name aubio comes from
'audio' with a typo: several transcription errors are likely to be found in
the results too.

The aim of this project is to provide these automatic labelling features to
other audio softwares. Functions can be used offline in sound editors and
software samplers, or online in audio effects and virtual instruments.

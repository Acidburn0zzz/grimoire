LuaSocket is a Lua extension library that is composed by two parts: a
C core that provides support for the TCP and UDP transport layers, and
a set of Lua modules that add support for the SMTP (sending e-mails),
HTTP (WWW access) and FTP (uploading and downloading files) protocols
and other functionality commonly needed by applications that deal with
the Internet.

LuaJIT has been successfully used as a scripting middleware in games, 3D
modellers, numerical simulations, trading platforms and many other specialty
applications. It combines high flexibility with high performance and an
unmatched low memory footprint: less than 125K for the VM plus less than 85K
for the JIT compiler (on x86).

LuaJIT has been in continuous development since 2005. It's widely considered to
be one of the fastest dynamic language implementations. It has outperformed
other dynamic languages on many cross-language benchmarks since its first
release often by a substantial margin. In 2009 other dynamic language VMs
started to catch up with the performance of LuaJIT 1.x. Well, I couldn't let
that slide. ;-)

For LuaJIT 2.0, the whole VM has been rewritten from the ground up and
relentlessly optimized for performance. It combines a high-speed interpreter,
written in assembler, with a state-of-the-art JIT compiler.

An innovative trace compiler is integrated with advanced, SSA-based
optimizations and a highly tuned code generation backend. This allows a
substantial reduction of the overhead associated with dynamic language
features.

It's destined to break into the performance range traditionally reserved for
offline, static language compilers.

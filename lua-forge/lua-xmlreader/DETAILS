cat << EOF
lua-xmlreader provides the XmlReader API to Lua applications using LibXML2.
XmlReader is an API introduced in C# that is arguably easier to use than
SAX.  It provides a pull interface where you control the reader, which is
a cursor moving along the document. Call methods such as reader:name()
to get information about the current node and reader:read() to advance
to the next.  This has the advantage versus a tree model such as DOM that
the whole document does not need to be loaded into memory at once. The many
articles and tutorials available online referring to XmlReader/XmlTextReader
in C#, Java or other languages should all be useful if you want to better
understand this method of handling XML.

Why is a software verification platform.

This platform contains several tools:

* a general-purpose verification condition generator (VCG), Why, which is used
  as a back-end by other verification tools (see below) but which can also
  be used directly to verify programs (see for instance these examples) ;
* a tool Krakatoa for the verification of Java programs; * a tool Caduceus
for the verification of C programs; note that Caduceus is
  somewhat obsolete now and users should turn to Frama-C instead.

One of the main features of Why is to be integrated with many existing provers
(proof assistants such as Coq, PVS, Isabelle/HOL, HOL 4, HOL Light, Mizar
and decision procedures such as Simplify, Alt-Ergo, Yices, Z3, CVC3, etc.).

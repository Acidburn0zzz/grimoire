MLGMPIDL is a package offering an interface to the GMP and MPFR libraries
for OCaml version 3.07 or higher. The interface offers access to almost
all the functions of the library, and is decomposed into 7 submodules,
corresponding to C modules:

  * Mpz: GMP integers, with side-effect semantics (as in C library)
  * Mpq: GMP rationals, with side-effect semantics (as in C library)
  * Mpzf: GMP integers, with functional semantics
  * Mpqf: GMP rationals, with functional semantics
  * Mpf: GMP multiprecision floating-point numbers
  * Gmp_random: GMP random number functions
  * Mpfr: MPFR multiprecision floating-point numbers, with side-effect
    semantics (as in C library)
  * Mpfrf: MPFR multiprecision floating-point numbers, with functional
    semantics

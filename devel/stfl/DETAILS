STFL is a library which implements a curses-based widget set for text
terminals. The STFL API can be used from C, SPL, Python, Perl and Ruby. Since
the API is only 14 simple function calls big and there are already generic
SWIG bindings it is very easy to port STFL to additional scripting languages.

A special language (the Structured Terminal Forms Language) is used to
describe STFL GUIs. The language is designed to be easy and fast to write
so an application programmer does not need to spend ages fiddling around
with the GUI and can concentrate on the more interesting programming tasks.

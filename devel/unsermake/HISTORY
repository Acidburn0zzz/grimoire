	* DETAILS, DOWNLOAD, DEPENDS, PREPARE: switch to a mirrored tarball
	  (initially pulled from http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/
	  u/unsermake/unsermake_20051117.dfsg.orig.tar.gz) since svn repo is dead.
	  Unsermake seems to be dead, but there is at least one spell (kdenlive)
	  needing unsermake, so let's keep it.

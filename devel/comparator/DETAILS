comparator is a program for rapidly finding common segments in large
source-code trees.  See the manual page for instructions.  It comes with a
filtering postprecessor, filterator.

comparator and filterator are a pair of programs for identifying common
or closely matching segments in source trees. They are fast enough to give
near-instant results even on trees running to millions of lines each.

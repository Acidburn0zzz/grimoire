MzScheme is an implementation of the Scheme programming language for Windows,
Mac OS X, and Unix. The name is pronounced "miz scheme", as in "Ms. Scheme".

MzScheme is R5RS-compliant, including the full numerical tower. It also
provides threads (on all platforms), exceptions, modules, class-based
objects, Unicode, regular-expression matching, TCP/IP, and more.

MzScheme compiles Scheme to byte code. At run time on x86, x86_64, and
PowerPC platforms, MzScheme converts byte code to native code through a
just-in-time compiler. Alternately, on all platforms, the mzc compiler
produces native code via C to run in MzScheme.

MzScheme supports access to foreign functions and libraries directly from
Scheme, as well as MzScheme-specific extensions that are implemented in C/C++.
MzScheme can also be embedded as an extension language within a C/C++
application. Interoperability with C/C++ is facilitated by the use of a
conservative garbage collector.

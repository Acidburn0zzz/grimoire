Gnat_Util is a library uniting a number of GNAT sources that are used by
different tools. At the moment Gnat_Util provides GNAT sources needed by
ASIS, GNATCOLL and Gprbuild. Its main purpose is allowing to simultaneously
use tools like ASIS and GNATCOLL (and other ones based on GNAT sources, if
they are to come), which would normally cause name conflicts between the
same GNAT sources that they use. Building both of them using same set of
sources that is Gnat_Util solves this problem.

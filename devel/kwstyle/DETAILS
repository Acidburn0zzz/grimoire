KWStyle is a style checker for source code.

KWStyle is integrated in the software process to ensure that the code written
by several users is consistent and can be viewed/printed as it was written
by one person.

KWStyle is primarily checking C/C++ source code but can be easily extended
to other languages. It assumes that the code is syntaxically correct, i.e
it compiles on a standard compiler.


Among the fearures provided by KWStyle:

- Several Indentation checking - Copyright Header correctness - Maximum line
length - Encapsulation preservation - Internal variable checking via regular
expressions - New line at the end of file

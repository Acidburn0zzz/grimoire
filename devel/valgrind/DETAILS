Valgrind is an award-winning suite of tools for debugging and profiling
Linux programs. With the tools that come with Valgrind, you can
automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, avoiding
hours of frustrating bug-hunting, making your programs more stable. You
can also perform detailed profiling, to speed up and reduce memory use of
your programs.
The Valgrind distribution currently includes four tools: a memory error
detector, a cache (time) profiler, a call-graph profiler, and a heap
(space) profiler. It runs on the following platforms: X86/Linux,
AMD64/Linux, PPC32/Linux, PPC64/Linux.

cat << EOF
A+ is a powerful and efficient programming language.

It embodies a rich set of functions and operators, a modern graphical user
interface with many widgets and automatic synchronization of widgets and
variables, asynchronous execution of functions associated with variables and
events, dynamic loading of user compiled subroutines, and many other features.

Execution is by a rather efficient interpreter. A+ was created at Morgan
Stanley. Primarily used in a computationally-intensive business environment,
many critical applications written in A+ have withstood the demands of real
world developers over many years. Written in an interpreted language, A+
applications tend to be portable.

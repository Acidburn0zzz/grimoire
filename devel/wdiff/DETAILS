The GNU wdiff program is a front end to diff for comparing files on a word per
word basis. A word is anything between whitespace. This is useful for comparing
two texts in which a few words have been changed and for which paragraphs have
been refilled. It works by creating two temporary files, one word per line,
and then executes diff on these files. It collects the diff output and uses
it to produce a nicer display of word differences between the original files.

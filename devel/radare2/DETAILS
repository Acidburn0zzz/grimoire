radare is a reverse engineering framework with tools to disassemble, debug,
analyze and manipulate binary files. The tools provided form a unix-like
toolchain.
    * Multi-architecture multi-platform
        - GNU/Linux, BSD, OSX, iPhoneOS, Windows and Solaris
        - x86{32,64}, arm, java, powerpc, mips
        - PE{32,64}, [fat]MACH0{32,64}, ELF{32,64}, CLASS
    * Highly scriptable
        - Batch mode and native plugins with full internal API access
        - Vala, Go, Python, ruby, perl, lua, Java, shellscript, ..
        - Scripting language based in mnemonic commands and macros
    * Hexadecimal editor
        - 64bit offset support with virtual addressing and section maps
        - Assemble and disassemble from/to many architectures
        - Colorizes opcodes, bytes and debug register changes
        - Print data in various formats (int, float, disasm, timestamp, ..)
        - Search multiple patterns or keywords with binary mask support
        - Checksumming and data analysis of byte blocks
    * IO is wrapped
        - Support Files, disks, processes and streams
        - Virtual addressing with sections and multiple file mapping
        - Handles gdb:// and rap:// remote protocols
    * Debugger support
        - Software and hardware breakpoints
        - Tracing and logging facilities
    * Diffing between two functions or binaries
        - Graphviz friendly code analysis graphs
        - Colorize nodes and edges
    * Code analysis at opcode, basicblock, function levels
        - Embedded simple virtual machine to emulate code
        - Keep track of code and data references
        - Function calls and syscall decompilation
        - Function description, comments and library signatures

Development tools that work with programming languages benefit from their
ability to understand the code with which they work at a level comparable
to a compiler.

C++ has become a popular and powerful language, but parsing it is a very
challenging problem. This has discouraged the development of tools meant to
work directly with the language.

There is one open-source C++ parser, the C++ front-end to GCC, which is
currently able to deal with the language in its entirety. The purpose of
the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML description of a C++ program
from GCC's internal representation.

Since XML is easy to parse, other development tools will be able to work
with C++ programs without the burden of a complicated C++ parser.

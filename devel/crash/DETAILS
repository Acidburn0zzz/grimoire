cat << EOF
The core analysis suite is a self-contained tool that can be used to
investigate either live systems, kernel core dumps created from dump
creation facilities such as kdump, kvmdump, xendump, the netdump and diskdump
packages offered by Red Hat, the LKCD kernel patch, the mcore kernel patch
created by Mission Critical Linux, as well as other formats created by
manufacturer-specific firmware.

  o The tool is loosely based on the SVR4 crash command, but has been
    completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display formatted
    kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.

  o The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source
    code disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered, which
    in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.

  o There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile adds it
    to the command menu.

  o The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

cat << EOF
The Ada Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) is an interface between
an Ada environment (as defined by ISO/IEC 8652:1995) and any tool or
application requiring information from it. An Ada environment includes
valuable semantic and syntactic information. ASIS is an open and published
callable interface which gives CASE tool and application developers access
to this information. ASIS has been designed to be independent of underlying
Ada environment implementations, thus supporting portability of software
engineering tools while relieving tool developers from needing to understand
the complexities of an Ada environment's proprietary internal representation.
In short, ASIS can provide the foundation for your code analysis activities.

cat << EOF
Trf is an extension library to the script language Tcl, as created by John
Ousterhout. It provides transformer procedures which change the flow of
bytes through a channel in arbitrary ways. The underlying functionlaity in
the core is that of ''stacked channels which allows code outside of the core
to intercept all actions (read/write) on a channel.

Among the applications of the above provided here are compression, charset
recording, error correction, and hash generation.

cgdb is a lightweight, but fully functional curses frontend to
gdb. The goal of cgdb is to be lightweight and responsive, not
encumbered with unnecessary features. The interface retains the
familiar GDB text-based interface with 100% of the original
functionality. The interfaces also provide additional features, such
as a source code window, shortcut keys, visual setting of breakpoints,
regex searching capabilities, and more.

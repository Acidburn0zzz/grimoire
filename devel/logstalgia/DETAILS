Logstalgia is a website traffic visualization that replays or streams Apache
web-server access logs as a pong-like battle between the web server and an
never ending torrent of requests.

Requests appear as colored balls (the same color as the host) which travel
across the screen to arrive at the requested location. Successful requests are
hit by the paddle while unsuccessful ones (eg 404 - File Not Found) are missed
and pass through.

The paths of requests are summarized within the available space by identifying
common path prefixes. Related paths are grouped together under headings. For
instance, by default paths ending in png, gif or jpg are grouped under the
heading Images. Paths that don't match any of the specified groups are lumped
together under a Miscellaneous section.

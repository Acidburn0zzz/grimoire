It's syntax is designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar
to Intel's but less complex.

It supports a range of object file formats, including Linux and NetBSD/
FreeBSD a.out and ELF, COFF, Microsoft 16-bit OBJ and Win32. It will also
output plain binary files.

It supports Pentium, P6, MMX, 3DNow!, SSE and SSE2 opcodes, and has macro

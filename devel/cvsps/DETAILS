CVSps is a program for generating 'patchset' information from a CVS
repository. A patchset in this case is defined as a set of changes made to a
collection of files, and all committed at the same time (using a single 'cvs
commit' command). This information is valuable to seeing the big picture of the
evolution of a cvs project. While cvs tracks revision information, it is often
difficult to see what changes were committed 'atomically' to the repository.

cat << EOF
Yruba provides a rule system similar to make or ant for the shell. Compared to
make there is no hairy mix of syntaxes, because everything is written in shell
syntax. Compared to ant you donâ€™t have to rely on the ant developers to
reinvent all the wheels that are so easily available from the shell. Compared
to both, there is a clear separation between:

	* a list of dependencies that must be up-to-date before the current
	  task can be performed,
	* an explicit test that checks whether the target is really
	  out-of-date, and
	* a command that finally makes the target.

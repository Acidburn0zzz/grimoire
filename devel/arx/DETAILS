ArX is a Revision Control System (RCS), like CVS, Subversion, or GNU
arch. It manages "archives" (collections of files), such as source
code files for a software project. It tracks the history of each file,
along with change comments, version tags, forks and branches, etc. It
can store files and documents of any kind, but the largest benefits are
with text files, rather than binary files.

cat << EOF
Meld is a GNOME 2 visual diff and merge tool. It integrates especially
well with CVS. The diff viewer lets you edit files in place (diffs
update dynamically), and a middle column shows detailed changes and
allows merges. The margins show location of changes for easy navigation,
and it also features a tabbed interface that allows you to open many
diffs at once.

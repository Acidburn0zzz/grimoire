radare is a toolchain that aims to create a complete set of utilities for
handling binary files from the command line. It's mainly a hexadecimal editor
for the command line but with advanced features. There are extensions for
debugging processes on x86-32 and ARM, libusb and fd sniffers, binary diffing
utilities, base format conversions, generating graphs of a program, a
cross-platform disassembler as an objdump frontend, and more.

radare is a toolchain that aims to create a complete set of utilities
for handling binary files from the command line. It's mainly a hexadecimal
editor for the command line but with advanced features. There are extensions
for debugging processes on x86-32 and ARM, libusb and fd sniffers, binary
diffing utilities, base format conversions, generating graphs of a program,
a cross-platform disassembler as an objdump frontend, and more.

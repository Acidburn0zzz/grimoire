cat << EOF
Repo is a repository management tool that we built on top of Git. Repo unifies
the many Git repositories when necessary, does the uploads to our revision
control system, and automates parts of the Android development workflow. Repo is
not meant to replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git in the context
of Android. The repo command is an executable Python script that you can put
anywhere in your path. In working with the Android source files, you will use
Repo for across-network operations. For example, with a single Repo command you
can download files from multiple repositories into your local working directory.

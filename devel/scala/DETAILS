Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express common
programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly
integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages, enabling Java
and other programmers to be more productive. Code sizes are typically reduced
by a factor of two to three when compared to an equivalent Java application.

cat << EOF
Q is an interpreted, dynamically typed functional programming language
based on term rewriting which allows you to define functions using symbolic
equations. It works on Linux, OS X, Unix and Windows, and comes with a
bunch of useful libraries which turn it into a practical programming tool.

It is being superceeded by pure, but pure has not yet reached the same
level of development.

cat << EOF
Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature is
its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.

This package contains the files necessary to build applications using the
deprecated QAssistantClient class, which is used together with the legacy
Assistant Document Profile (.adp) version of Qt Assistant.

This class is obsolete. It is provided to keep old source code working. It
is strongly advised against using it in new code. New code should use the
Qt Help Framework introduced in Qt 4.4 and/or the version of Qt Assistant
based on it (also introduced in Qt 4.4) instead.

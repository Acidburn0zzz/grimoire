DrScheme is an open source software interactive programming environment (IDE)
for the Scheme programming language which has a graphical user interface. It
is a key part of PLT Scheme, which contains a full implementation of R5RS
along with significant extensions. It is widely used among introductory
Computer Science courses that teach Scheme and is lauded for its simplicity
and appeal to beginner programmers. The IDE was originally built for use with
the TeachScheme! project, an outreach effort by Rice University and a number
of affiliated universities for attracting high school students to computer
science courses at the college level.

DrScheme is built on top of MzScheme and MrEd, two other components of
PLT Scheme.

cat << EOF
The compiler is based on the original Portable C Compiler by Stephen
C. Johnson, written in the late 70's. Even though much of the compiler has
been rewritten, some of the basics still remain.

PCC debuted in Unix Version 7 and replaced the DMR compiler (Dennis Ritchie's
original C compiler) in both System V and the BSD 4.x releases.

About 50% of the frontend code and 80% of the backend code has been
rewritten. Most stuff is written by Anders Magnusson, with the exception of
the data-flow analysis part and the SSA conversion code which is written by
Peter A Jonsson, and the MIPS port that were written as part of a project
by undergraduate students at Luleaa University of Technology (LTU).

The project goal is to write a C99 compiler while still keeping it small,
simple, fast and understandable.

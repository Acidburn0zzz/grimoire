The SCATC Project involves the creation of a DSK that contains generic
reusable architectures backed by a software components library which can be
used to create families of tools for source code analysis of both small and
large (more than 1 million lines of code) software systems written in Ada83,
Ada95, C, C++, Java, and VHDL.

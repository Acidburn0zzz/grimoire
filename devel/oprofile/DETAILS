cat << EOF
OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems, capable of profiling
all running code at low overhead. It consists of a kernel driver and a daemon
for collecting sample data, and several post-profiling tools for turning
data into information.
OProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the CPU to enable
profiling of a wide variety of interesting statistics, which can also be used
for basic time-spent profiling. All code is profiled: hardware and software
interrupt handlers, kernel modules, the kernel, shared libraries, and
applications.

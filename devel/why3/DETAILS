Why3 is the next generation of the Why software verification platform. Why3
clearly separates the purely logical specification part from generation of
verification conditions for programs. It features a rich library of proof
task transformations that can be chained to produce a suitable input for a
large set of theorem provers, including SMT solvers, TPTP provers, as well
as interactive proof assistants.

Supported provers: Alt-Ergo, Z3, CVC3, Yices 1, Simplify, Gappa, Coq.

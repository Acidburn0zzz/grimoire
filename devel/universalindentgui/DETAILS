UniversalIndentGUI offers a live preview for setting the parameters of nearly
any indenter. You change the value of a parameter and directly see how your
reformatted code will look like. Save your beauty looking code or create an
anywhere usable batch/shell script to reformat whole directories or just one
file even out of the editor of your choice that supports external tool calls.

Many free available code beautifier, formatter and indenter are currently
supported, like GNU Indent, Uncrustify, Artistic Styler, PHP Stylist, Ruby
Beautify, HTML Tidy and many other (look at features for complete list).
Currently not supported indenters can be easily added by creating a
configuration file for them.

Thus UniversalIndentGUI is open for nearly any new indenter and programming
language. Give it a try. Perhaps you'll also find an indenter for your
programming language you even didn't know that it exists.

cat << EOF
Applications built with Tcl/Tk come together with relative ease. A sticky
note facility can be put together in an hour. A simple video game can be
created in an afternoon. But as applications get larger, Tcl/Tk code becomes
more and more difficult to understand, maintain and extend.

[incr Tcl] provides the extra language support needed to build large Tcl/Tk
applications. It introduces the notion of objects, which act as building blocks
for an application. Each object is a bag of data with a set of procedures or
"methods" that are used to manipulate it. Objects are organized into "classes"
with identical characteristics, and classes can inherit functionality from
one another. This object-oriented paradigm adds another level of organization
on top of the basic variable/procedure elements, and the resulting code is
easier to understand and maintain.

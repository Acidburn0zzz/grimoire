cat << EOF
geanyvc is plugin that provides a uniform way of accessing the different
version-control systems inside Geany IDE. Only small subset of vc is
implemented, but, hey, you don't need anything besides diff, log, status,
revert and commit most time.

geanyvc currently support the following version control systems:

Bazaar, GIT, Mercurial, Subversion, SVK:
 * diff file
 * diff directory
 * diff project
 * blame
 * log file
 * log directory
 * log project
 * status
 * revert file
 * add file
 * remove file
 * commit
 * blame

CVS:
 * diff file
 * diff directory
 * diff project
 * log file
 * log directory
 * log project
 * status
 * revert file

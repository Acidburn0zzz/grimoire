GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. It can be
used to run binary code for (among others) MIPS-based machines. Several
emulation modes are available. For some emulation modes, processors and
surrounding hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified
operating systems (eg. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

The Template Numerical Toolkit (TNT) is a collection of interfaces and
reference implementations of numerical objects useful for scientific computing
in C++. The toolkit defines interfaces for basic data structures, such as
multidimensional arrays and sparse matrices, commonly used in numerical
applications. The goal of this package is to provide reusable software
components that address many of the portability and maintennace problems
with C++ codes.

TNT provides a distinction between interfaces and implementations of
TNT components. For example, there is a TNT interface for two-dimensional
arrays which describes how individual elements are accessed and how certain
information, such as the array dimensions, can be used in algorithms;
however, there can be several implementations of such an interface: one
that uses expression templates, or one that uses BLAS kernels, or another
that is instrumented to provide debugging information. By specifying only
the interface, applications codes may utilize such algorithms, while giving
library developers the greatest flexibility in employing optimization or
portability strategies.

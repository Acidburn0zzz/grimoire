cat << EOF
Jim is an opensource small-footprint implementation of the Tcl programming
language. It implements a large subset of Tcl and adds new features like
references with garbage collection, closures, built-in Object Oriented
Programming system, Functional Programming commands, first-class arrays and
UTF-8 support. All this with a binary size of about 100-200kB (depending
upon selected options).

The Jim core is very stable. Jim passes over 3000 unit tests and many
Tcl programs run unmodified. Jim is highly modular with the possiblity to
configure many components as loadable modules, or omitted entirely. A number
of extensions are included with Jim which may be built as loadable modules.

cat << EOF
CamlIDL is a stub code generator and COM binding for Objective Caml.

CamlIDL comprises two parts:

* A stub code generator that generates the C stub code required for the Caml/C
  interface, based on an MIDL specification. (MIDL stands for Microsoft's
  Interface Description Language; it looks like C header files with some
  extra annotations, plus a notion of object interfaces that look like C++
  classes without inheritance.)

* A (currently small) library of functions and tools to import COM components
  in Caml applications, and export Caml code as COM components.

sas is a Shell ASsembler written in pure POSIX shell. It is tested under
various shells to ensure that it has few to no bashisms and is portable as
possible. There is a logically separated assembler core and separate ISA
instruction set files (e.g. x86.set). It assembles much slower than native
assemblers (such as nasm, yasm, gas, etc.), but is much smaller and its only
dependencies are a functioning shell, tr, printf, and cat, so it might be
useful in constrained systems (penetration testing, embedded, educational,
etc.).

cat << EOF
Tcl provides a portable scripting environment for Unix, Windows, and
Macintosh that supports string processing and pattern matching, native
file system access, shell-like control over other programs, TCP/IP
networking, timers, and event-driven I/O. Tcl has traditional
programming constructs like variables, loops, procedures, namespaces,
error handling, script packages, and dynamic loading of DLLs.

Memchan is an extension library to the script language Tcl, as created by
John Ousterhout. It provides several new channel types for in-memory channels
and the appropriate commands for their creation.

They are useful to transfer large amounts of data between procedures or
interpreters, and additionally provide an easy interface to on-the-fly
generation of code or data too. No need to [set] or [append] to a string,
just do a simple [puts].

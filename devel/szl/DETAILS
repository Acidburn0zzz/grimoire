szl is a tiny, embeddable scripting engine inspired by Tcl and shell. It's a
balanced mix of their key features: szl combines the simplicity of shell
scripting with the power of a dynamic, Tcl-like type system, minimalistic
syntax and programming language features missing in the shell, like exceptions.

szl comes with a rich standard library that includes bindings for
permissively-licensed libraries. Therefore, it can run processes, parse text
with transparent Unicode support, manipulate data structures like dictionaries,
operate on binary data, interface with C code through scripts, multiplex
non-blocking I/O at scale, call REST APIs and much more, at a fraction of the
memory and size footprint of other scripting languages, while achieving
reasonable efficiency.

szl can be used both as a standalone (either interactive or non-interactive)
interpreter or as part of other projects, via the libszl library.

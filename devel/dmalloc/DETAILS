cat << EOF
The debug memory allocation or dmalloc library has been designed as a drop in
replacement for the system's malloc, realloc, calloc, free and other memory
management routines while providing powerful debugging facilities configurable
at runtime. These facilities include such things as memory-leak tracking,
fence-post write detection, file/line number reporting, and general logging
of statistics.

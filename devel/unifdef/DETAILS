Unifdef is useful for removing #ifdef'ed lines from a file while otherwise 
leaving the file alone. You specify which symbols are defined or undefined with
-D and -U flags, and unifdef removes the corresponding ifdefs, and the enclosed
code if appropriate. It's especially useful for removing those "#ifdef BROKEN"
and "#ifdef PRIVATE" clauses from code before you release it. Unifdef acts on 
#ifdef, #ifndef, #else, and #endif lines, and it knows only enough about C and
C++ to know when one of these is inactive because it is inside a comment, or a
single or double quote.

nwcc is a simple C compiler for Unix systems targeting a variety of
architectures. Full source code is freely available under the (revised)
BSD license.

It works with Linux/Mac OS X/FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Solaris on 80x86, Linux/Mac
OS X/FreeBSD/OpenBSD on AMD64, Solaris/Linux on SPARC, AIX/Linux on PowerPC,
and IRIX on MIPS hardware. Apart from full C89 support, nwcc also provides
many C99 and GNU C features, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for
gcc in many cases. Cross-compilation and PIC code for shared libraries are
also supported, albeit incompletely.

nwcc has been known to compile many small and medium sized open-source
applications correctly - such as bash, xterm, vim, wget, gxemul, lynx, lsof,
strace, zsh, GNU less/tar/make and others - but the degree of code correctness
varies between supported platforms, and large applications still tend to
expose bugs (at some point, nwcc was capable of compiling some versions of
gcc, Apache, PHP and PostgreSQL correctly on x86 systems.)

Development priorities have traditionally favored language feature support,
portability and compatibility. As a result, nwcc is completely lacking in
optimization and support for debugging or profiling, and still suffers from
code correctness problems - particularly on RISC platforms.

CLooG is a free software and library to generate code for scanning Z-polyhedra.
That is, it finds a code (e.g. in C, FORTRAN...) that reaches each integral
point of one or more parameterized polyhedra. CLooG has been originally
written to solve the code generation problem for optimizing compilers based
on the polytope model. Nevertheless it is used now in various area e.g. to
build control automata for high-level synthesis or to find the best polynomial
approximation of a function. CLooG may help in any situation where scanning
polyhedra matters. While the user has full control on generated code quality,
CLooG is designed to avoid control overhead and to produce a very effective
code.

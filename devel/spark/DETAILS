SPARK is a formally-defined computer programming language based on the Ada
programming language, intended to be secure and to support the development of
high integrity software used in applications and systems where predictable
and highly reliable operation is essential either for reasons of safety
(e.g., avionics in aircraft/spacecraft, or medical systems and process
control software in nuclear powerplants) or for business integrity (for
example financial software for banking and insurance companies).

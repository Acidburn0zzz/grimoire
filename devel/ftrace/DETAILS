           SHORT="Utility to Trace Local Function Calls"
cat << EOF
fTrace dynamically traces a non-stripped command until it exits.
It prints to stderr all the local function calls which the program calls and
reports possible arguments and return values of each function.
It was programmed with intentional compatibility with such tools as strace
and ltrace in mind, but rather than it's elder parents, it was more designed
for program development than binary analysis.
Of course, if a binary hasn't been stripped, it is still possible that fTrace
may provide some helpful information.

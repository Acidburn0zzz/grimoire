# GraphViz includes a hack that automatically redirects certain font names
# to certain versions of so called URW Postscript fonts. The error that results
# from such redirection is as follows (trailing font name may change):
#   Error: fontconfig: Didn't find expected font family. Perhaps URW Type 1 fonts need installing? : Times-Roman
# This patch removes said hack.

graphviz is a set of graph drawing tools for Unix or MS-Windows
(win32), including a web service interface (webdot). Graph drawing
addresses the problem of visualizing structural information by
constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and
networks. Automatic generation of graph drawings has important
applications in key technologies such as database design, software
engineering, VLSI and network design and visual interfaces in other
domains.

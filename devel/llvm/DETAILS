cat << EOF
Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a compiler infrastructure designed for
compile-time, link-time, run-time, and "idle-time" optimization of programs
from arbitrary programming languages. It currently supports compilation of
C, Objective-C, and C++ programs, using front-ends derived from GCC 4.0,
GCC 4.2, and a custom new front-end, "clang". It supports x86, x86_64, ia64,
PowerPC, and SPARC, with support for Alpha and ARM under development.

cat << EOF
Typical middleware implementations for one platform supports only one set of
such interfaces, pre-defined configuration capabilities and cannot interoperate
with other platforms. In addition to traditional middleware implementations,
PolyORB proposes an original architecture to enable support for multiple
interoperating distribution models in a uniform canvas.

PolyORB is a polymorphic, reusable infrastructure for building or prototyping
new middleware adapted to specific application needs. It provides a set of
components on top of which various instances can be elaborated. These instances
(or personalities) are views on PolyORB facilities that are compliant to
existing standards, either at the API level (application personality) or at
the protocol level (protocol personality). These personalities are mutually
exclusive views of the same architecture.

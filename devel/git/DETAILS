This is the Source Code Management system that kernel.org uses for the linux
kernel, the reason for this move was because they were using bitkeeper (a
non-GPL scm) and had a special licence to use it, however the plug was pulled
from bitkeeper and linus was forced to find something else.

So I just wanted to say that I'm personally very happy with BK, and with Larry.
It didn't work out, but it sure as hell made a big difference to kernel
development. And we'll work out the temporary problem of having to figure out
a set of tools to allow us to continue to do the things that BK allowed us to
do.
Let the flames begin.

Chrony is an implementation of Network Time Protocol by Richard Curnow.
It handles an intermittently connected computer better than the ntp program,
but does not yet know how to use a hardware reference clock (GPS receiver,
cesium clock, etc.)

It has two programs: chronyd, the daemon, which talks on UDP port 123 to
other time servers, and chronyc, which asks chronyd on port 323 how well
it's keeping time.

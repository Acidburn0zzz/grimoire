cat << EOF
Gip provides system administrators with tools for IP address based
calculations. For example, an administrator who needs to find out which IP
prefix length equals the IP netmask 255.255.240.0, just types in the mask
and gets the prefix length presented. But many more advanced calculations can
be made. Gip can convert an address range into a list of prefix lengths. It
can also split subnets using a given IP netmask or IP prefix length. Many
more calculations are possible.

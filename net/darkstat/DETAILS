cat << EOF
darkstat is an ntop-workalike network statistics gatherer. It runs as a
background process on a cable or DSL router, uses libpcap to capture network
traffic, and has a Web interface that serves up reports of statistics such
as data transferred by host, port, and protocol. It also has a neat bandwidth
usage graph.

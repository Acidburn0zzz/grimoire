cat << EOF
OLSR is a routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks.  The protocol is
pro-active, table driven and utilizes a technique called multipoint relaying
for message flooding. olsrd also implements a popular optional link quality
extension.

Olsrd is ment to be a well structured and well coded implementation
that should be easy to maintain, expand and port to other platforms.
The implementation is RFC3626 compliant with respect to both core and
auxiliary functioning. Olsrd supports use of loadable plugins.  These can
be used to to handle and generate custom packettypes to be carried by OLSRs
MPR flooding scheme or for any other desired functioning.

Olsrd is much used in community-driven free wireless networks all across
the world.

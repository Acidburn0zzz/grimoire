Megatools is a collection of programs for accessing Mega service from a command
line of your desktop or server.

Megatools allow you to copy individual files as well as entire directory trees
to and from the cloud. You can also perform streaming downloads for example to
preview videos and audio files, without needing to download the entire file.

You can register account using a 'megareg' tool, with the benefit of having true
control of your encryption keys.

Megatools are robust and optimized for fast operation - as fast as Mega servers
allow. Memory requirements and CPU utilization are kept at minimum.

Mega website can be found at mega.co.nz.

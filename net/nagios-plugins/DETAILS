cat << EOF 
Nagios is a host and service monitor designed to inform you of network 
problems before your clients, end-users or managers do. It has been designed
to run under the Linux operating system, but works fine under most *NIX 
variants as well. The monitoring daemon runs intermittent checks on hosts and 
services you specify using external "plugins" which return status information 
to Nagios. When problems are encountered, the daemon can send notifications 
out to administrative contacts in a variety of different ways (email, instant 
message, SMS, etc.). Current status information, historical logs, and reports 
can all be accessed via a web browser.

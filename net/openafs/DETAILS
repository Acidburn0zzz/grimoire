AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon University
and supported and developed as a product by Transarc Corporation (now IBM
Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server architecture for file sharing,
providing location independence, scalability, security, and transparent
migration capabilities for data.

IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance.

They called the release OpenAFS.

cat << EOF
Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP
server. It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a
small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are
not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS
server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to
appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or in
a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic
DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless machines.

Dnsmasq is targeted at home networks using NAT and connected to
the internet via a modem, cable-modem or ADSL connection but
would be a good choice for any small network where low resource
use and ease of configuration are important.

The aim of the project is to develop an open source iSCSI target with
professional features, that works well in enterprise environment under real
workload, and is scalable and versatile enough to meet the challenge of future
storage needs and developments.

The project was started by forking the Ardis target implementation, with respect
to the GPL. While the Ardis target implementation was a very good one, it lacked
several key needs, including SMP support, Linux 2.6 kernel support, 64-bit
architecture support, dynamic configuration, iSNS support and more.

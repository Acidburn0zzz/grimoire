Traceroute is a system administrators utility to trace the route IP packets take
from a source system to some destination system.

Traceroute uses the IP TTL (Time To Live) parameter to find the route. It sends
a packet with a TTL value equal to 1. The first router receives the packet and
decreases the TTL. With a TTL equal to 0, the router sends a timeout back to
traceroute, with this packet, traceroute knows about the first router. Now,
traceroute sends another packet with a TTL equal to 2. The first router
decreases the TTL and sends the packet to the second router which decreases it
in turn: the TTL is equal to 0...

With this method, traceroute can trace the route to a distant computer.

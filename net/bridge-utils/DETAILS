Bridging is the act of connecting together multiple ethernets to appear as one
large ethernet to the participating hosts. This is done by having one device
with multiple ethernet interfaces, called a bridge, listen on all its
interfaces for packets, including packets that are not destined to it, and
selectively resend these packets on other interfaces. This process is totally
transparent to the participating hosts.

How do you know whether you want bridging? In general, it's hard to say. There
is a simple guideline, however. If you want to connect multiple ethernets
together which are all part of the same IP subnet, bridging is what you want.
Conversely, if you want to connect different IP subnets together, bridging is
not what you want (you want routing instead).

FreeRADIUS is the premiere open source RADIUS server. While detailed
statistics are not available, we believe that FreeRADIUS is well
within the top 5 RADIUS servers world-wide, in terms of the number
of people who use it daily for authentication. It scales from
embedded systems with small amounts of memory, to systems with
millions of users. It is fast, flexible, configurable, and supports
more authentication protocols than many commercial servers.

The FreeRADIUS Server Project encompasses more than just a RADIUS
server. The related software includes a PAM authentication module,
and an Apache 1.3 and 2.0 authentication module. The server comes
with a PHP-based web user administration tool, called dialupadmin.

The RADIUS server has more features and is more flexible than any
other free software RADIUS server, and many commercial servers. Most
commercial servers are distributed as a "base" system ($), and an
"enhanced" version ($$) with more features. FreeRADIUS has all the
features of a commercial "enhanced" server, without the associated
cost.

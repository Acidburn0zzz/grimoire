The in-kernel CIFS filesystem is generally the preferred method for mounting
SMB/CIFS shares on Linux. More information on Linux CIFS is available at
the Linux CIFS VFS site.

The in-kernel CIFS filesystem relies on a set of user-space tools. That
package of tools is called cifs-utils. Although not really part of Samba
proper, these tools were originally part of the Samba package. For several
reasons, shipping these tools as part of Samba was problematic and it was
deemed better to split them off into their own package.

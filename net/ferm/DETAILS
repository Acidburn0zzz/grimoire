cat << EOF
ferm is a tool to maintain complex firewalls, without having the trouble to
rewrite the complex rules over and over again. ferm allows the entire firewall
rule set to be stored in a separate file, and to be loaded with one command.
The firewall configuration resembles structured programming-like language,
which can contain levels and lists.

IPTraf-ng is a console-based network monitoring utility. IPTraf-ng gathers
data like TCP
connection packet and byte counts, interface statistics and activity
indicators, TCP/UDP
traffic breakdowns, and LAN station packet and byte counts. IPTraf-ng features
include an IP
traffic monitor which shows TCP flag information, packet and byte counts,
ICMP details, OSPF
packet types, and oversized IP packet warnings; interface statistics showing
IP, TCP, UDP,
ICMP, non-IP and other IP packet counts, IP checksum errors, interface
activity and packet
size counts; a TCP and UDP service monitor showing counts of incoming and
outgoing packets
for common TCP and UDP application ports, a LAN statistics module that
discovers active hosts
and displays statistics about their activity; TCP, UDP and other protocol
display filters so you
can view just the traffic you want; logging; support for Ethernet, FDDI,
ISDN, SLIP, PPP, and
loopback interfaces; and utilization of the built-in raw socket interface
of the Linux kernel,
so it can be used on a wide variety of supported network cards

IPTraf-ng is a console-based network monitoring utility. IPTraf-ng gathers data like TCP 
connection packet and byte counts, interface statistics and activity indicators, TCP/UDP 
traffic breakdowns, and LAN station packet and byte counts. IPTraf-ng features include an IP 
traffic monitor which shows TCP flag information, packet and byte counts, ICMP details, OSPF 
packet types, and oversized IP packet warnings; interface statistics showing IP, TCP, UDP, 
ICMP, non-IP and other IP packet counts, IP checksum errors, interface activity and packet 
size counts; a TCP and UDP service monitor showing counts of incoming and outgoing packets 
for common TCP and UDP application ports, a LAN statistics module that discovers active hosts 
and displays statistics about their activity; TCP, UDP and other protocol display filters so you 
can view just the traffic you want; logging; support for Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN, SLIP, PPP, and 
loopback interfaces; and utilization of the built-in raw socket interface of the Linux kernel, 
so it can be used on a wide variety of supported network cards

IPTraf-ng is a console-based network monitoring utility. IPTraf-ng gathers data
like TCP connection packet and byte counts, interface statistics and activity
indicators, TCP/UDP traffic breakdowns, and LAN station packet and byte counts.
IPTraf-ng features include an IP traffic monitor which shows TCP flag
information, packet and byte counts, ICMP details, OSPF packet types, and
oversized IP packet warnings; interface statistics showing IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP,
non-IP and other IP packet counts, IP checksum errors, interface activity and
packet size counts; a TCP and UDP service monitor showing counts of incoming
and outgoing packets for common TCP and UDP application ports, a LAN statistics
module that discovers active hosts and displays statistics about their
activity; TCP, UDP and other protocol display filters so you can view just the
traffic you want; logging; support for Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN, SLIP, PPP, and
loopback interfaces; and utilization of the built-in raw socket interface of
the Linux kernel, so it can be used on a wide variety of supported network
cards.

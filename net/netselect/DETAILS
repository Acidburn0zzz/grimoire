Netselect is an ultrafast intelligent parallelizing binary-search
implementation of "ping."  It determines several facts about all of
the hosts given on the command line, much faster than you would if
you manually tried to use ping and traceroute.  It selects the best
of them to use as a download mirror based on the results.

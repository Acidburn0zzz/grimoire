cdpr (Cisco Discovery Protocol Reporter) shows the switch and port 
that a machine is connected to, provided that the device supports CDP. 
It can also optionally decode the full CDP packet. cdpr was written to 
help network/system administrators find out about the equipment that a 
machine is connected to. This is done by capturing and decoding a Cisco 
Discovery Protocol (CDP) packet.

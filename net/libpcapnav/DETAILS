cat << EOF
A libpcap wrapper library that allows navigation to arbitrary locations in a
tcpdump trace file between reads. The API is intentionally much like that of
the pcap library. You can navigate in trace files both in time and space: you
can jump to a packet which is at appr. 2/3 of the trace, or you can jump as
closely as possible to a packet with a given timestamp, and then read packets
from there. In addition, the API provides convenience functions for
manipulating timeval structures.

If you are currently using Shorewall-shell:

    a) In shorewall.conf, if you have specified
       "SHOREWALL_COMPILER=shell" then you must either:

       -  change that specification to "SHOREWALL_COMPILER=perl"; or
       -  change that specification to "SHOREWALL_COMPILER="; or
       -  delete the specification altogether.

       Failure to do so will result in the following warning:

       WARNING: SHOREWALL_COMPILER=shell ignored. Shorewall-shell
                support has been removed in this release.

    b) Review the migration issues at
       http://www.shorewall.net/LennyToSqueeze.html and make changes as
       required.

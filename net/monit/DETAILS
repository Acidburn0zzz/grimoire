Monit is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, files, directories,
and devices on a Unix system. It conducts automatic maintenance and repair
and can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations. It can be used
to monitor files, directories, and devices for changes, such as timestamps
changes, checksum changes, or size changes. It is controlled via an easy to
configure control file based on a free-format, token-oriented syntax. It logs
to syslog or to its own log file and notifies users about error conditions
via customizable alert messages. It can perform various TCP/IP network checks,
protocol checks, and can utilize SSL for such checks. It provides an HTTP(S)
interface for access.

cat << EOF
It offers the following features:
 * Understands NetFlow protocol v.1, v.5, v.7 and v.9 (including IPv6 flows)
 * Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 transport of flows
 * Secure: flowd is privilege separated to limit the impact of any compromise
 * Supports filtering and tagging of flows, using a packet filter-like syntax
 * Stores recorded flow data in a compact binary format which supports run-time
   choice over which flow fields are stored
 * Ships with both Perl and Python interfaces for reading and parsing the
   on-disk record format
 * Supports reception of flow export datagrams sent to multicast groups (IPv4
   and IPv6), thereby allowing the construction of redundant flow collector
   systems

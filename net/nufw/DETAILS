NuFW is an authentication firewall suite:
the gateway authorizes a packet depending on which remote user has sent it.
It can also set quality of service on a per-user basis and log user activities
into a SQL database.
Furthermore, it can use an external authentication source such as an LDAP
directory and be the key of
a Single Sign On solution.

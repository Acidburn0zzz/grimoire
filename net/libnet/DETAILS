cat << EOF
Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application programmer to
construct and inject network packets. It provides a portable and simplified
interface for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection. Libnet
hides much of the tedium of packet creation from the application programmer
such as multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header information,
byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more. Libnet features portable
packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link layer, as well as a host
of supplementary and complementary functionality.

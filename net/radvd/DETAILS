cat << EOF
The router advertisement daemon (radvd) is run by Linux or BSD systems acting
as IPv6 routers. It sends Router Advertisement messages, specified by RFC 2461,
to a local Ethernet LAN periodically and when requested by a node sending a
Router Solicitation message. These messages are required for IPv6 stateless
autoconfiguration.

This release includes support for Mobile IPv6, 6to4 addressing, and
non-broadcast multiple-access links such as ISATAP. Both Linux and BSD are
supported. For more information about recent modifications, please see the
CHANGES file included with the latest release of radvd.

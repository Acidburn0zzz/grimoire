The inetd server is a network daemon program that specializes in managing
incoming network connections. Its configuration file tells it what program
needs to be run when an incoming connection is received. Any service port
may be configured for either of the tcp or udp protocols.

This is a port of the OpenBSD daemon with some debian-specific features. This
package supports IPv6, built-in libwrap access control, binding to specific
addresses, UNIX domain sockets and socket buffers tuning.

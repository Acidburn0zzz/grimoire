cat << EOF
Amap was the first next-generation scanning tool for pentesters.  It attempts
to identify applications even if they are running on a different port
than normal.  It also identifies non-ascii based applications. This is
achieved by sending trigger packets, and looking up the responses in a list
of response strings.

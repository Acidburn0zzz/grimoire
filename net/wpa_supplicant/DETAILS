cat << EOF
wpa_supplicant is a WPA Supplicant for Linux, BSD, and Windows with 
support for WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN). It is suitable for 
both desktop/laptop computers and embedded systems. Supplicant is the 
IEEE 802.1X/WPA component that is used in the client stations. It 
implements key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and it controls the 
roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the wlan driver.

wpa_supplicant is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs in the 
background and acts as the backend component controlling the wireless 
connection. wpa_supplicant supports separate frontend programs and a 
text-based frontend (wpa_cli) and a GUI (wpa_gui) are included with 
wpa_supplicant.

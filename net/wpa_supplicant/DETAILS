wpa_supplicant is a WPA Supplicant for Linux, BSD, and Windows with support for
WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN). It is suitable for both desktop/laptop
computers and embedded systems. Supplicant is the IEEE 802.1X/WPA component that
is used in the client stations. It implements key negotiation with a WPA
Authenticator and it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/
association of the wlan driver.

wpa_supplicant is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs in the background
and acts as the backend component controlling the wireless connection.
wpa_supplicant supports separate frontend programs and a text-based frontend
(wpa_cli) and a GUI (wpa_gui) are included with wpa_supplicant.

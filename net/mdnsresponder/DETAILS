cat << EOF
The mDNSResponder project meets 2 requirements of the Bonjour project:

1. Name-to-address translation (even when there is no DNS server)
2. Discovery of Services on the network (again, without infrastucture)

It provides the ability for the user to identify hosts using names
instead of dotted-decimal IP addresses, even if the user doesn't have a
conventional DNS server set up. It also provides the ability for the
user to discover what services are being advertised on the network,
without having to know about them in advance, or configure the machines.

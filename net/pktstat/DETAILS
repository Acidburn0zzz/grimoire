Pktstat displays a real-time list of active connections seen on a network
interface, and how much bandwidth
is being used by what. Partially decodes HTTP and FTP protocols to show what
filename is being transferred.
X11 application names are also shown. Entries hang around on the screen for
a few seconds so you can see
what just happened. Also accepts filter expressions ? la

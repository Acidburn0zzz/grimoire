cat << EOF
tcpstat reports certain network interface statistics much like vmstat does
for system statistics. tcpstat gets its information by either monitoring a
specific interface, or by reading previously saved tcpdump data from a file.

Some of the statistics tcpstat calculates:

    * bandwidth
    * number of packets
    * packets per second
    * average packet size
    * standard deviation of packet size
    * interface load
    * more...

tcpstat is written with performance and efficiency in mind and is capable of
handling large amounts of packets per second. Its compact command line
interface
is geared for the network researcher, system administrator and
desktop shell user. tcpstat has been a valuable tool in university research
papers and commercial networks alike.

tcpdump is a CLI based packet sniffer/network debugging tool. It's extensively
used by networking guys to find out what's wrong or rather what's not right :)

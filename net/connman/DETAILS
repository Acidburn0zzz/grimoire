cat << EOF
The ConnMan project provides a daemon for managing internet connections within
embedded devices running the Linux operating system. The Connection Manager is
designed to be slim and to use as few resources as possible, so it can be 
easily integrated. It is a fully modular system that can be extended, through
plug-ins, to support all kinds of wired or wireless technologies. Also, 
configuration methods, like DHCP and domain name resolving, are implemented 
using plug-ins. The plug-in approach allows for easy adaption and modification
for various use cases.

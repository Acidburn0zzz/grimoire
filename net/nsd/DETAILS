The NLnet Labs Name Server Daemon (NSD) is an authoritative RFC compliant
DNS nameserver. It was first conceived to allow for more genetic diversity
for DNS server implementations used by the root-server system and it has
been developed for operations in environments where speed, reliability,
stability, and security are of high importance.

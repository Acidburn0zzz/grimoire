The NLnet Labs Name Server Daemon (NSD) is an authoritative RFC compliant DNS
nameserver. It was first conceived to allow for more genetic diversity for DNS
server implementations used by the root-server system and it has been developed
for operations in environments where speed, reliability, stability, and security
are of high importance.

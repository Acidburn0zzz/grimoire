NTP (Network Time Protocol) tries to keep servers in sync

Very usefull with GPS timesources, but typically used in a third
level setup to your ISP (Which typicall syncs to a first level timesource)

Several methods, use "ntpd -g -q ntp.server.dom" in a crontab
(or after connecting), or create /etc/ntp.conf and start "ntpd -g"

The -g is needed to enable a big step, otherwise it takes too long to sync.

Note: issue the "ntpd -g" command ASAP after the network is initialized,
and check out ntp-wait to not have it take too long to sync in why other
server's starts (and their logs get bad).
It's fastest slew rate is 0.5ms/sec, ie. 2000 secs to fix a secon

Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data across
network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable
"back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs
and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and
exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would
need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.

It provides access to the following main features:

 * Outbound and inbound connections, TCP or UDP, to or from any ports.
 * Featured tunneling mode which allows also special tunneling such as UDP to
   TCP, with the possibility of specifying all network parameters (source
   port/interface, listening port/interface, and the remote host allowed to
   connect to the tunnel.
 * Built-in port-scanning capabilities, with randomizer.
 * Advanced usage options, such as buffered send-mode (one line every N
   seconds), and hexdump (to stderr or to a specified file) of trasmitted and
   received data.
 * Optional RFC854 telnet codes parser and responder.

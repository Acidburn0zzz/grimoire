cat << EOF
Softflowd semi-statefully tracks traffic flows. Upon expiry of a flow, its
statistics are accumulated and reports them to a designated collector host using
the standard NetFlow protocol. Currently the statistics collected are summaries
only: min/max/avg/total bytes, packets on a aggregate or per-protocol basis.

Softflowd can export using NetFlow version 1, 5 or 9 datagrams and it is fully
IPv6 capable: it can track and report on IPv6 traffic and flow export datagrams
can be sent to an IPv6 host. Any standard NetFlow collector should be able to
process the reports from softflowd.

As softflowd watches traffic promiscuously, it is likely to place additional
load on hosts or gateways on which it is installed. However, this implementation
has been designed to minimise this load as much as possible. Alternately,
softflowd can read pcap save files recorded from tcpdump and friends.

Unless reading from a traffic dump, softflowd run as a daemon. A "remote
control" program (softflowctl) is included which allows runtime control and
extraction of statistics from a daemonised softflowd.

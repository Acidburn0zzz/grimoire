cat << EOF
The ebtables program is a filtering tool for a Linux-based bridging firewall.
It enables transparent filtering of network traffic passing through a Linux
bridge. The filtering possibilities are limited to link layer filtering and
some basic filtering on higher network layers. Advanced logging, MAC DNAT/SNAT
and brouter facilities are also included.

The ebtables tool can be combined with the other Linux filtering tools
(iptables, ip6tables and arptables) to make a bridging firewall that is also
capable of filtering these higher network layers. This is enabled through the
bridge-netfilter architecture which is a part of the standard Linux kernel.

The ebtables and arptables codebase is maintained by the netfilter developers,
who were so kind to take over maintenance of the software. This website is kept
mainly as a documentation reference.

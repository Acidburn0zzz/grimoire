djbdns is a collection of Domain Name System tools. It includes
software for all the fundamental DNS operations:

 * DNS cache: finding addresses of Internet hosts. When a browser wants
   to contact www.hotwired.com, it first asks a DNS cache, such as
   djbdns's dnscache, to find the IP address of www.hotwired.com.
   Internet service providers run dnscache to find IP addresses
   requested by their customers. If you're running a home computer or a
   workstation, you can run your own dnscache to speed up your web
   browsing.
 * DNS server: publishing addresses of Internet hosts. The IP address
   of www.hotwired.com is published by HotWired's DNS servers. djbdns
   includes a general-purpose DNS server, tinydns; network
   administrators run tinydns to publish the IP addresses of their
   computers. djbdns also includes special-purpose servers for
   publishing DNS walls and RBLs.
 * DNS client: talking to a DNS cache. djbdns includes a DNS client C
   library and several command-line DNS client utilities. Programmers
   use these tools to send requests to DNS caches. 

djbdns also includes several DNS debugging tools, notably dnstrace,
which administrators use to diagnose misconfigured remote servers.

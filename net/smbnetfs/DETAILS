 SMBNetFS is a Linux/FreeBSD filesystem that allow you to use samba/microsoft
 network in the same manner as the network neighborhood in Microsoft Windows.

 Features:
  - Linux-2.4, Linux-2.6, FreeBSD-6.0 supported - you can use Samba/Microsoft
  network as a regular unix filesystem - workgroup/computer/share entries
  are dynamically created - windows domain supported - user defined
  workgroup/link/hosts are supported - national character supported - in
  config files you can specify different user/password to access different
    network shares
  - you can access any computer in the world by "cd mountpoint/ip-addr"
    command, where "ip-addr" is the IP address of the desired computer. Do
    not warry that there is no file with such name :-)
  - command "cd mountpoint/username:password@computer_or_ip" allows you to
    access "computer_or_ip" as user "username" with password "password"
    (this is insecure, but usefull)
  - the program is multithreaded, so simultaneous access to a file/share
    is possible
  - config files are reloaded every 5 min or by SIGHUP signal - sources

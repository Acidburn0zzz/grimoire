ZeroMQ (also known as Ã˜MQ, 0MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking
library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry
atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP,
and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fan-out,
pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric
for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore
applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks.

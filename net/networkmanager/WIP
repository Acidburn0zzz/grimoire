Compiles, but not sure if it works yet.

It doesn't. The RedHat backend is too much different imho. After correcting the 
path to ip from /sbin to /usr/sbin, NetworkManager still exits after launching.
It is looking for the network scripts in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ to get
the configuration.
We could try Slackware backend, however it doesn't implement yet all the features
of the software. The main problems with the other backends are the retrieval of
the networking configuration and the dns stuff (with nscd and mDNSresponder).

Otherwise, during installation, dbus daemon exists which is quite annoying. I
didn't investigate yet.

cat << EOF
DNRD is a proxy DNS daemon. It supports several forward servers for redundancy
and/or load-balancing. DNS queries for specific domains can be forwarded
to a specific group of DNS servers (with redundancy and load balancing)
for that domain. It is very useful in VPN and dialup environments but can
also be used as a DNS cache or ad-blocker for networks and workstations.

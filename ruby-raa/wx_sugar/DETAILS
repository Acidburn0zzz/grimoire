cat << EOF
wx_sugar is a set of pure-ruby extensions that work on top of the core wxRuby
library. Originally, it was a testing place for syntax additions that made
the C++-based wxRuby core library more Ruby-ish. Now, most of these syntax
extensions have been added into the core library, so you don't need to
install any extra libraries to get all that Ruby-ish syntax sugar.

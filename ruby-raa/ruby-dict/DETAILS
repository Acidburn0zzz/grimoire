Ruby/DICT is an RFC 2229 compliant client-side library implementation of
the DICT protocol. It can be used to write clients that access dictionary
definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases.   In
addition, rdict, a command-line based dictionary client built on Ruby/DICT,
is included.   Changes in 0.9.3   A bug was fixed, whereby a text response
could be mistaken for a numeric status response.   Changes in 0.9.2  
When a non-default matching strategy is used with rdict and no definitions
are found, an message is now displayed. A warning when running with Ruby
1.8 was also fixed.   Changes in 0.9.1   The rdict client now accepts
multiple words as arguments on the command line and performs dictionary
look-ups for each of them in turn.

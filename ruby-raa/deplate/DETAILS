cat << EOF
deplate is a converter for wiki-like markup with output to LaTeX, HTML (single
page, chunked), DocBook, and really plain text. It can read viki/deplate
markup and rdoc files. It supports most markup elements needed for complex
documents (e.g., footnotes, citations, index, table of contents, embedded
LaTeX for mathematics). Output can be customized via page templates. deplate
can create Web pages and (via LaTeX or Docbook) high-quality printouts from
the same source. It is the accompanying converter for the Vim viki plugin.  
deplate can read:   * deplate markup (viki vim plugin) in several variants:
full, restricted, template 
    * ruby rdoc 
 deplate can write:   * HTML: single page, web site (chunked), web-based
presentation (chunked &amp; condensed) 
    * LaTeX  * Docbook  * Really plain text  * Php (basically the same
    as HTML output) 
 0.8  This release contains many small changes and fixes. The main
user-visible improvements are: better support for bibliographies, embedded
elements in lists, task lists, a general style attribute, custom listings,
hierarchical counters, load-time-expanded skeletons etc.   0.8.1

improvements. Some incompatible changes were made (users can set variables
to enforce the previous behaviour). New features include: support for
dvipng, play input format, output via LaTeX's dramatist class, guesslanguage
module to guess the document's language, linkmap module for an alternative
(markdown-like) markup of URLs.

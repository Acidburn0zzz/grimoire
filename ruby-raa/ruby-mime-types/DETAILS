This library allows for the identification of a file’s likely MIME content
type. This is release 1.15. The identification of MIME content type is based
on a file’s filename extensions.

MIME::Types for Ruby originally based on and synchronized with MIME::Types
for Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2005. As of version 1.15, the
data format for the MIME::Type list has changed and the synchronization will
no longer happen.

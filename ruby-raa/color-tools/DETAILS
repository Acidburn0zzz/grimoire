color-tools README color-tools is a Ruby library to provide RGB, CMYK,
and other colourspace support to applications that require it. It also
provides 152 named RGB colours. It offers 152 named RGB colours (184 with
spelling variations) that are commonly supported and used in HTML, SVG, and X11
applications. A technique for generating a monochromatic contrasting palette is
also included.  Version 1.3 offers significant enhancements over color-tools
1.2, and a plan for an incompatible change to the library.  Colours that were
defined in the Color namespace (e.g., Color::Red, Color::AliceBlue) are now
defined in Color::RGB (e.g., Color::RGB::Red, Color::RGB::AliceBlue). They
are added back to the Color namespace on the first use of the old colours and
a warning is printed. In version 1.4, this warning will be printed on every
use of the old colours. In version 1.5, the backwards compatible support for
colours like Color::Red will be removed completely.  A CSS colour name module
has been added. It is based on the Color::RGB predefined colours. It is called
with "Color::CSS[color]". The provided colour name will be looked
up ignoring case so that "DarkSalmon" and "darksalmon"
(and :darksalmon) are the same value. This makes it easier on web or
SVG developers who wish to be able to manipulate a colour based on a CSS
colour name.  A new predefined colour namespace has been added for RGB
metallic colours (Color::Metallic, in color/rgb/metallic), suggested by
Jim Freeze <jfn@freeze.org>.  A new colour space, Color::HSL (hue,
saturation, and luminosity) has been added with some helper methods to
Color::RGB for colour manipulation.  Added unit tests and fixed various
little bugs.  Copyright Copyright 2005 by Austin Ziegler Color::Palette

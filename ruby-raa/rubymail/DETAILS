This is RubyMail, a lightweight mail library containing various mail
utility classes and modules.  Very high attention is paid to quality
and robustness. This package has a complete unit test suite (requires
RubyUnit to run). Currently all of my e-mail is processed by this library.
Changes in RubyMail 1.0.0 (released 2008-01-05) This version differs only
in the changes required for Ruby 1.9 support. It is otherwise "bug
compatible" with version 0.17.  Users of version 0.17 can safely upgrade
to 1.0.0. You will lose the ability to run the tests if you are using Ruby
1.6 (but who is doing that these days?).  Add a Rakefile. Add a gem hosted
on rubyforge.org.  Changes in RubyMail 0.17 (released 2004-04-27) Handle
parsing addresses with non-ASCII display names. We don’t do anything
intelligent with the non-ASCII data, but it is passed through in its original
(invalid) non-encoded form.  Look for From_ lines only on the first line when
parsing a message.  RMail::Header#subject= now sets the header field name to
"Subject" instead of "subject" since some mail reading
software is case sensitive and can’t understand "subject:foo".
The RMail parser now requires only whitespace after MIME multipart boundary
lines. This violates RFC2046’s "NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS"
documented in testparsermultipart.rb’s test_multipart_data_12, but it
allows real-world messages created by Eudora to be parsed.

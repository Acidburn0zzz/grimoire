Ruby Enterprise Edition is a server-oriented friendly branch of Ruby which
includes various enhancements:
	A copy-on-write friendly garbage collector. Phusion Passenger uses this, in
	combination with a technique called preforking, to reduce Ruby on Rails
	applications' memory usage by 33% on average.
	An improved memory allocator called tcmalloc, which improves performance quite
	a bit.
	The ability to tweak garbage collector settings for maximum server performance,
	and the ability to inspect the garbage collector's state. (RailsBench GC patch)
	The ability to dump stack traces for all running threads
	(caller_for_all_threads), making it easier for one to debug multithreaded Ruby
	web applications.

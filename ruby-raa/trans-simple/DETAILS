cat << EOF
Transaction::Simple for Ruby Transaction::Simple provides a generic way to
add active transaction support to objects. The transaction methods added
by this module will work with most objects, excluding those that cannot be
Marshal-ed (bindings, procedure objects, IO instances, or singleton objects).
The transactions supported by Transaction::Simple are not associated with any
sort of data store. They are "live" transactions occurring in memory
on the object itself. This is to allow "test" changes to be made
to an object before making the changes permanent.  Transaction::Simple can
handle an "infinite" number of transaction levels (limited only by
memory). If I open two transactions, commit the second, but abort the first,
the object will revert to the original version.  Transaction::Simple supports
"named" transactions, so that multiple levels of transactions can
be committed, aborted, or rewound by referring to the appropriate name of
the transaction. Names may be any object except nil.  Transaction groups are
also supported. A transaction group is an object wrapper that manages a group
of objects as if they were a single object for the purpose of transaction
management. All transactions for this group of objects should be performed
against the transaction group object, not against individual objects in
the group.  Version 1.4.0 of Transaction::Simple adds a new post-rewind hook
so that complex graph objects of the type in tests/tc_broken_graph.rb can
correct themselves.  Copyright:Copyright Â© 2003 - 2007 by Austin Ziegler

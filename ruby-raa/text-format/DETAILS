Text::Format 1.0.0 Text::Format is provides the ability to nicely format
fixed-width text with knowledge of the writeable space (number of columns),
margins, and indentation settings. Text::Format can work with either
TeX::Hyphen or Text::Hyphen to hyphenate words when formatting.  This is
release 1.0, containing both feature enhancements and bug fixes over the
previous version, 0.64.  Text::Format is originally based on the Perl library
of the same name by Gábor Egressy. It is copyright 2002 - 2005 by Austin
Ziegler and is licenced under Ruby’s licence. It is also available under
the Perl Artistic licence.  Text::Format 1.0.0 Changed installer: added a .gem
package.  Changed installer: moving to a variant of setup.rb by Minero Aoki.
Fixed significant problems with #hard_margin wrapping and fallback issues,
eliminating all known possibilities for an infinite loop in wrapping. Some
of the formatting changes involved with this result in different and more
subtle wrapping and splitting of words; please read the full documentation
for details.  Clarified the API for #hyphenate_to (delineated the return value
required if the hyphenator cannot hyphenate the word to the specified size).
Changed a number of public and private API calls to work better. As long as the
constants provided by Text::Format have been used (and not direct access to the
constant values), there will be no issues presented by most of these changes.
Changed the initialization of the Text::Format object. The documentation
has also been updated to be correct. Note that this will mean that some
uses of Text::Format will not work, as Text::Format.new now yields self if
a block is given instead of evaluating the block with Object#instance_eval.
Added text numbering generators (Text::Format::Alpha, Text::Format::Number,
and Text::Format::Roman) to work with #tag_paragraphs and #tag_text to
generate numbered paragraphs.  #nobreak_regex must be a hash of regular
expressions, not strings that are converted to regular expressions. This
Perlism has finally been removed.  The performance has been improved; the
number of times that lines are joined together and then split apart has
been reduced.  Changed the dependency to Text::Hyphen from TeX::Hyphen.
Added auto-split capabilities to #paragraphs. See the updated documentation.

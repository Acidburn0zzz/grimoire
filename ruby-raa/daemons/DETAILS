cat << EOF
Daemons provides an easy way to wrap existing ruby scripts (for example a
self-written server) to be run as a daemon and to be controlled by simple
start/stop/restart commands.

If you want, you can also use daemons to run blocks of ruby code in a daemon
process and to control these processes from the main application.

Besides this basic functionality, daemons offers many advanced features like
exception backtracing and logging (in case your ruby script crashes) and
monitoring and automatic restarting of your processes if they crash.

Daemons includes the daemonize.rb script written by Travis Whitton to do the
daemonization process.

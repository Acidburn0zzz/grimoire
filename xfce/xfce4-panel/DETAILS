cat << EOF
xfce4-panel is the panel of the XFce Desktop Environment. It is modeled
slightly after the CDE panel and, of course, previous versions of xfce.
The panel provides program lauchers, detachable, non-hierarchical menus
(easier to read at a glance), and several panel 'plugins' like a clock
and a pager. Additional plugins may be installed separately.

Xfce power manager manages the power sources on the computer and the
devices that can be controlled to reduce their power consumption (such as
LCD brightness level, monitor sleep, CPU frequency scaling). In addition,
xfce4-power-manager provides a set of freedesktop-compliant DBus interfaces
to inform other applications about current power level so that they can
adjust their power consumption, and it provides the inhibit interface which
allows applications to prevent automatic sleep actions via the power manager;
as an example, the operating system's package manager should make use of
this interface while it is performing update operations.

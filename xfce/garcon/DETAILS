cat << EOF
This is garcon, a freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation based
on GLib and GIO. It was started as a complete rewrite of the former
Xfce menu library called libxfce4menu, which, in contrast to garcon,
was lacking menu merging features essential for loading menus modified
with menu editors.

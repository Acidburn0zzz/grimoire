The DiskPerf plugin displays disk/partition performance based on the
rsect/wsect data provided by recent Linux kernels (at least 2.4.20 - I think -
compiled wit h CONFIG_BLK_STATS turned on, or possibly older kernel patched
with "Disk extended statistics" in /proc/partitions).

To know if your system provides such statistics:
        - less /proc/partitions
        - check that there are rsect/wsect data

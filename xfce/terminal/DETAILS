cat << EOF
Terminal is a modern terminal emulator for the Unix/Linux desktop, primarly for
the Xfce desktop environment. It was developed because Xfce needed a
lightweight and easy-to-use terminal emulator that didn't require the user to
install the GNOME libraries, but still provided a worthy alternative to the
GNOME terminal emulator, with all the bells and whistles.

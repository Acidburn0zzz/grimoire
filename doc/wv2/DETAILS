wv (formerly known as MSWordView) is a library that understands the
Microsoft Word 2000, 97, 95 and 6 file formats and is able to convert 
Word documents into HTML, which can then be read with a browser. It
also allows other programs access to word documents for the purpose
of converting them to other formats and is currently being used by
Abiword as its word importer.

cat << EOF
UnRTF is a command-line program written in C which converts documents in Rich
Text (.rtf) format to HTML, LaTeX, PostScript, and other formats. Converting
to HTML, it supports a number of features of Rich Text Format:

  * Changes in the text's font, size, weight (bold), and slant (italic)
  * Underlines and strikethroughs * Partial support for text shadowing,
  outlining, embossing, or engraving * Capitalizations * Superscripts and
  subscripts * Expanded and condensed text * Changes in the foreground and
  background colors

Because program is not yet complete, support for features when converting
to other file formats varies.

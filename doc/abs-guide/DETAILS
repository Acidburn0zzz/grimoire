cat << EOF
This document is both a tutorial and a reference on shell scripting with Bash.
It assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, but progresses
rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction. The exercises and
heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation. Still, it is a
work in progress. The intention is to add much supplementary material in future
updates to this document, as it evolves into a comprehensive book that matches
or surpasses any of the shell scripting manuals in print.

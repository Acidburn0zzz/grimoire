dvipdfmx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) is a development of dvipdfm created to
support multi-byte character encodings and large character sets for East
Asian languages. Dvipdfmx, if “called” with the name dvipdfm, operates
in a “dvipdfm compatibility” mode, so that users of the both packages
need only keep one executable.

A secondary design goal is to support as many “PDF” features as does
pdfTeX (pdftex).

There being no documentation as such, users are advised to consult the
documentation of dvipdfm (as well, of course, as the package Readme).

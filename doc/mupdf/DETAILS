The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. It
renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel
for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. It supports PDF 1.7 with
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, searching and more.

It also reads OpenXPS documents.

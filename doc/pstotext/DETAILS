pstotext is a program that works with Ghostscript (version 3.33 or later)
to extract plain text from PostScript and PDF files (you should have
Ghostscript 3.51 or later for PDF). 

There are other programs to do this, but they all fail on numerous common
examples. We've tested pstotext on a wide variety of PostScript files, and
for each of them pstotext could extract the words correctly (though
sometimes the word order was a bit strange).

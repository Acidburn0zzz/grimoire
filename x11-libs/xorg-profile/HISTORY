	* DETAILS: Actually rename SPELL to xorg-profile
	* DEPENDS: Don't depend on deprecated xf86-video-i810
	  Don't depend on any fonts, xorg-server does that for us
	* UP_TRIGGERS: Fix missing 'do' after for
	  provider x11_libs_provider are variables, not commands
	  Not sure what I was thinking...the providers will be gone for this
	  so we cannot query them via `gaze provides`, instead just check
	  the spells specifically and then check what depends on them.

	* DEPENDS: Depends on xorg-data-profile

2007-10-25 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* Changed to modular X.org profile spell from monolithic X.org
	  Optionally depends on all drivers

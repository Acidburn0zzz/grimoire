cat << EOF
The Direct Rendering Infrastructure, also known as the dri, is a framework for allowing direct 
access to graphics hardware in a safe and efficient manner. It includes changes to the X server, to 
several client libraries, and to the kernel. The first major use for the DRI is to create fast 
OpenGL implementations.

Technology
 - soniK uses the aRts sound system from KDE which means a wide variety of soundcards are supported. Future versions of soniK will also use the JACK sound system which provides real-time, low-latency sound input/output. 
 - soniK uses LADSPA plugins to apply effects to sound files. Several packages of plugins are available, providing hundreds of effects and you should install some of these to get the most out of soniK. Available packages include: 
   -- SWH plugins - http://plugin.org.uk.
   -- Computer Music Toolkit - http://www.ladspa.org/cmt/. 
   -- Tom's Audio Processing plugins - http://tap-plugins.sourceforge.net/.
 - soniK uses KDE's network transparency features to allow you to edit files on remote machines

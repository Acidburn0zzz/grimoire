QSynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around the 
Qt3 toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve into a softsynth 
management application allowing the user to control and manage a variety of 
command line softsynth but for the moment it wraps the excellent Fluidsynth. 
Fluidsynth is a command line software synthesiser based on the Soundfont 
specification.

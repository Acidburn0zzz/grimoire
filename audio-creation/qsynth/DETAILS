cat << EOF
Qsynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around the
Qt4 toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve into a softsynth
management application allowing the user to control and manage a variety of
command line softsynth but for the moment it wraps the excellent FluidSynth.
FluidSynth is a command line software synthesiser based on the Soundfont
specification.

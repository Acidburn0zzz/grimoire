Seq24 is a minimal loop based midi sequencer for linux. It was created to 
provide a very simple interface for editing and playing midi 'loops'. After 
searching for a software based sequencer that would provide the functionality 
needed for a live performance, such as the Akai MPC line, the Kawai Q80 
sequencer, or the popular Alesis MMT-8, I found nothing similar in the 
software realm. I set out to create a very minimal sequencer that excludes 
the bloated features of the large software sequencers, and includes a small 
subset of features that I have found usable in performing.

ChucK is a new audio programming language for real-time synthesis, composition,
and performance - fully supported on MacOS X, Windows, and Linux. ChucK
presents a new time-based concurrent programming model, which supports a 
highly precise and fundamental level of expressiveness (we call this 
strongly-timed), as well as multiple, simultaneous, dynamic control rates, 
precise and straightforward concurrency, and the ability to add, remove,
and modify code, on-the-fly, while the program is running. In addition,
ChucK supports MIDI, OSC, HID input devices, and multi-channel
audio. It offers composers, researchers, and performers a powerful and
flexible programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio
synthesis programs and real-time interactive
control. Its syntax and semantics also makes ChucK potentially useful for
pedagogy in sound synthesis and programming.

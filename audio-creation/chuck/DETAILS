ChucK is a new audio programming language for real-time synthesis, composition, and performance - fully supported on MacOS X, Windows, and Linux. ChucK presents a new time-based concurrent 
programming model, which supports a highly precise and fundamental level of expressiveness (we call this strongly-timed), as well as multiple, simultaneous, dynamic control rates, precise and 
straightforward concurrency, and the ability to add, remove, and modify code, on-the-fly, while the program is running. In addition, ChucK supports MIDI, OSC, HID input devices, and multi-channel 
audio. It offers composers, researchers, and performers a powerful and flexible programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio synthesis programs and real-time interactive 
control. Its syntax and semantics also makes ChucK potentially useful for pedagogy in sound synthesis and programming.

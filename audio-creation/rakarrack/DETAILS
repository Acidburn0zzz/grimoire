Rakarrack is a richly featured multi-effects processor emulating a guitar
effects pedalboard. Presets and user interface are optimized for guitar,
but Rakarrack processes signals in stereo while it does not apply internal
band-limiting filtering, and thus is well suited to all musical
instruments and vocals. Rakarrack is designed for Linux distributions with
Jack Audio Connection Kit.

guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running with jack (Jack
Audio Connection Kit).  It takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp
would do: as a mono-signal from your sound card. Your tone is processed by
a main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately and deliver a
processed stereo-signal via Jack. You may fill the rack with effects from more
than 25 built-in modules spanning from a simple noise-gate to brain-slashing
modulation-fx like flanger, phaser or auto-wah.

eSpeak is a software speech synthesizer for English and other languages.
eSpeak produces good quality English speech. It uses a different synthesis
method from other open source TTS engines, and sounds quite different. It's
perhaps not as natural or "smooth", but I find the articulation clearer and
easier to listen to for long periods.  It can run as a command line program to
speak text from a file or from stdin. A library version is also available.

Features:
* Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered.
* Can produce speech output as a WAV file.
* SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) is supported (not complete), and also
HTML.
* Compact size. The program and its data, including several languages, totals
about 420 kbytes.
* Can translate text to phoneme codes, so it could be adapted as a front end
for another speech synthesis engine.
* Potential for other languages. Several are included in varying stages of
progress. Help from native speakers for these or other languages is welcomed.
* Development tools available for producing and tuning phoneme data.
* Written in C++.

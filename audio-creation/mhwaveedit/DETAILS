mhWaveEdit is a graphical program for editing, playing and recording sound
files. It is lightweight, portable, user-friendly and handles large files very
well.

The program itself has only simple editing features such as cut'n'paste and
volume adjustment but it can also use Ladspa effect plugins and the effects
provided by the SoX application. It can also support additional file formats
besides wav through libsndfile and mp3/ogg import and export through lame and
oggenc/oggdec.

For sound playback and recording, mhWaveEdit supports OSS, ALSA, Jack, SDL,
PortAudio and EsounD.

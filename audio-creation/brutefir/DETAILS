cat << EOF
BruteFIR is a software convolution engine, a program for applying long FIR
filters to multi-channel digital audio, either offline or in realtime. Its
basic operation is specified through a configuration file, and filters,
attenuation and delay can be changed in runtime through a simple command line
interface. The FIR filter algorithm used is an optimised frequency domain
algorithm, partly implemented in hand-coded assembler, thus throughput is
extremely high. In realtime, a standard computer can typically run more than
10 channels with more than 60000 filter taps each.

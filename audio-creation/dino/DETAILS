Dino is a MIDI sequencer for GNU/Linux. It is free software released under
the GNU General Public License.

Dino is a pattern-based sequencer, which means that you write small patterns
of MIDI events that you can repeat and arrange to create a whole song. Each
track has its own patterns, so you can for example play the same drum pattern
over and over again while you play different lead synth patterns and basslines.

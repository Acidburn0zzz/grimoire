Ardour is a digital audio workstation. You can use it to record, edit and mix
multi-track audio. You can produce your own CDs, mix video soundtracks, or
just experiment with new ideas about music and sound.

Ardour capabilities include: multichannel recording, non-destructive editing
with unlimited undo/redo, full automation support, a powerful mixer, unlimited
tracks/busses/plugins, timecode synchronization, and hardware control from
surfaces like the Mackie Control Universal. If you've been looking for a tool
similar to ProTools, Nuendo, Pyramix, or Sequoia, you might have found it.

KBFX is an alternative to the classical K-Menu button and its menu. It
improves the user experience by enabling the user to set a bigger (and
thus more visible) start button and by finally replacing the Win95-like
K-Menu. But if you still want the old menu, because you're used to it, it
is still available as an option in kbfx. We recommend, however, that you
give the Spinx bar a try.

Epsilon is a flexable and powerful image thumbnailing library that is complient
with the freedesktop.org Thumbnail Managing Standard. Unlike Epeg, Epsilon has
native support for PNG, and is built upon Imlib2 making any format supported by
Imlib2 such as JPEG, PNG, XCF, TIFF and GIF. To provide the best possible
performance Epsilon can even integrate with Epeg directly to harness its speed.

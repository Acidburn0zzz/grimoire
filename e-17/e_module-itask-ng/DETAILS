cat << EOF
This is an application launcher and taskbar based on the good old engage. for
this module you should have composite manager like xcompmgr or kompmgr of
bling running. Check out Itask in action. I recommend using the detour theme,
since it makes e's internal border icons zoom correctly.

If you want to use it with a composite manager you have to start the cm before
the module is loaded (or restart e after you started the composite manager).

Though it works pretty well without composite, but does not look as good ;) a
mode to draw on the desktop is also available. so you'll get nice
transparency but with less usability imho.. anyhow some people wished it

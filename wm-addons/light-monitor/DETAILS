light-monitor is a transparent panel with dependency only on X and Xft for
40Ko. It is distributed under the license GPLv2.

Those two programs are written to consume the lowest possible resources. Used
with sawfish, you can have an incredible low resources consumption for
the desktop.

light-monitor is base on widgets to display the state of the computer (a la
gtkrellm). Current widgets are:

* vol Manages the volume (pcm and vol). To change the current volume just
  clic on it or use the mouse-wheel.
* cpufreq Manages the scaling_governor : blue means powersave, blue and
  green means ondemand, and blue green and red stands for performance. To
  change to the next one, just clic on the processor
* load Shows the current load on the system and the processor temperature

* time Shows the time * date Shows the date * network Shows the cumulative
bandwidth over all network interfaces except lo.
  It is hidden if current upload and download are null
* ac Shows if the power supply is plugged for laptop * battery Shows the
current percentage of remaining charge in the battery if it
  is not full. IF ac is unplugged, it shows an estimation of the remaining
  time too.

netwmpager is an enhanced version of the original netwmpager-1.11 program
written around 2005 by Timo Hirvonen. It should be compliant with the EWMH
(or NetWM) specifications. This version implements virtual desktops split into
different viewports, into different desks, or both, while the earlier version
only supported desks. As a consequence, netwmpager-2 should work with most
window managers; it has been tested especially with compiz, fluxbox, and fvwm.
It also has many parametrizable features, and it implements a convenient zoom.

A lightweight desktop environment which runs on top of any windowmanager.

From the website:
Razor-qt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on
Qt technologies.  It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed,
and an intuitive interface.  Unlike most desktop environments, Razor-qt also
works fine with weak machines.

Skippy-XD is a version of Skippy that uses the new XDamage, XComposite and
XFixes extensions (found in FreeDesktop.org's Xserver project) to provide you
with 'live' versions of the windows.

Skippy is a full-screen task-switcher for X11. On a keypress (F11 by default,
but customizable) all windows are resized for a moment to such a size that they
all fit on the screen. When you click on one, the windows are resized back with
the clicked one focused up-front.

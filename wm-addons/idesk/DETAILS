iDesk gives users of minimal wm's (fluxbox, pekwm, windowmaker...) icons
on their desktop. The icon graphics are either from a png or svg (vector)
file and support some eyecandy effects like transparency. Each icon can be
confgured to run one or more shell commands and the actions which run those
commands are completely configurable. In a nutshell if you want icons on
your desktop and you don't have or dont't want KDE or gnome doing it, you
can use idesk.

Goldendict has the following features:

  * Use of WebKit for an accurate articles' representation, complete with
  all formatting, colors, images and links.

  * Support of multiple dictionary file formats, namely:
    - Babylon .BGL files, complete with images and resources - StarDict
      .ifo/.dict./.idx/.syn dictionaries - Dictd .index/.dict(.dz) dictionary
      files - ABBYY Lingvo .dsl source files, together with abbreviations. The
      files can be optionally compressed with dictzip. Dictionary resources can be
      packed together into a .zip file.
    - ABBYY Lingvo .lsa/.dat audio archives. Those can be indexed separately, or
      be referred to from .dsl files.

  * Support for Wikipedia, Wiktionary, or any other MediaWiki-based sites
    to perform lookups in.

  * Ability to use arbitrary websites as dictionaries via templated Url
    patterns.

  * Ability to run arbitrary external programs for audio playback or content
    generation (text-to-speech, man pages etc) (use the latest Git version
    for this)

  * Support for looking up and listening to pronunciations from forvo.com

  * Hunspell-based morphology system, used for word stemming and spelling
    suggestions.

  * Ability to index arbitrary directories with audio files for pronunciation
    lookups.

  * Full Unicode case, diacritics, punctuation and whitespace folding. This means
    the ability to type in words without any accents, correct case,
    punctuation or spaces (e.g. typing 'Grussen' would yield 'grüßen'
    in German dictionaries).

  * Scan popup functionality. A small window pops up with the translation
    of a word chosen from another application.

  * Support for global hotkeys. You can spawn the program window at any point, or
    directly translate a word from the clipboard.

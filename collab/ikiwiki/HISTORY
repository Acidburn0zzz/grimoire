	* CONFIGURE: added, query for search engine support
	* DEPENDS: depend on xapian-omega in addition to search-xapian, but
	  only if the user wants search engine support

	* DEPENDS: suggest having a webserver

	* DEPENDS: found another perl module it needs
	  Also, in this software cgi-session uses db_file (not sure if it needs
	  to be attached to cgi-session or this one)
	  Added cgi-formbuilder to support CGIs. This is going to be a pain to
	  calculate all the missing dependencies, since they're not nicely
	  spelled out somewhere for us...

	* BUILD: use default_build_perl
	* PRE_BUILD: added, replace line from Makefile.PL provided from upstream
	  that forces install in /usr/local to install to /usr

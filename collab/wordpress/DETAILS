WordPress is a state-of-the-art, semantic, personal publishing platform
with a focus on aesthetics, Web standards, and usability. It was born out
of a desire for an elegant, well-architectured personal publishing system,
and is the official successor to b2/cafelog. While primarily geared towards
functioning as a Weblog, it is also a flexible CMS capable of managing many
types of Web sites. In addition to the basic Weblog functions, it also has
an integrated link manager (e.g. for blogrolls), XFN support, support for
&quot;static&quot; pages, Atom and RSS feeds for both content and comments,
XML-RPC blogging API support (Blogger, MetaWeblog, and Movable Type APIs),
spam blocking features, advanced cruft-free URL generation, a flexible theme
system, and an advanced plugin API.

hellanzb is a Python application designed for *nix environments that retrieves
nzb files and fully processes them. The goal being to make getting files
from Usenet (e.g.: Giganews Newsgroups) as hands-free as possible. Once fully
installed, all thats required is moving an nzb file to the queue directory. The
rest; fetching, par-checking, un-raring, etc. is taken care of by hellanzb.

CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework.
 
 CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they would build 
any other object-oriented Python program. This usually results in smaller source code 
developed in less time.
 
 CherryPy is now more than three years old and it is has proven very fast and stable. It is 
being used in production by many sites, from the simplest ones to the most demanding ones.

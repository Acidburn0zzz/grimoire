cat << EOF
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design.

Developed and used over two years by a fast-moving online-news operation,
Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a
newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who
wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.

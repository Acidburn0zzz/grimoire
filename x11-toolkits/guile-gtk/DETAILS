cat << EOF
Guile-gtk is glue code to make the GTK+ (the Gimp Toolkit) accesible from
Guile so it provides a convenient interface for Scheme programmers to develop
visual applications. It can optionally integrate with gnome via the Gnome-guile
module.

Guile-gtk has been started by Marius Vollmer and is currently mantained by 
Ariel Rios and other intrepid Guile hackers around the world.

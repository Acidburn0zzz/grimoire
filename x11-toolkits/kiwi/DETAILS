cat << EOF
Kiwi consists of a set of classes and wrappers for PyGTK that were developed
to provide a sort of framework for applications. Fully object-oriented, and
roughly Smalltalk's MVC, Kiwi provides a simple, practical way to build forms,
windows and widgets that transparently access and display your object data.
Kiwi was primarily designed to make implementing the UI for Stoq easier, and
it is released under the LGPL. Kiwi is inspired by Allen Holub's Visual Proxy.

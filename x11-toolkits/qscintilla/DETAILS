cat << EOF
QScintilla is a port to Qt of Neil Hodgson's Scintilla C++ editor class.
As well as features found in standard text editing components, QScintilla
includes features especially useful when editing and debugging source code.
These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion
and call tips. The selection margin can contain markers like those used in
debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are
more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold
and italics, multiple foreground and background colours and multiple fonts.

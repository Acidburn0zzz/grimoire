QScintilla is a port to Qt of Neil Hodgson's Scintilla C++ editor class. 
 As well as features found in standard text editing components, QScintilla includes features 
especially useful when editing and debugging source code. These include support for syntax 
styling, error indicators, code completion and call tips. The selection margin can contain 
markers like those used in debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line. Styling 
choices are more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold 
and italics, multiple foreground and background colours and multiple fonts.

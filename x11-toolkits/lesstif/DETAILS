cat << EOF
LessTif is an LGPL'd implemention of the OSF/Motif standard GUI
toolkit for X11. LessTif aims to be source compatible with the
OSF/Motif versions 1.2 and 2.1. Currently 1.2 support is almost
complete and most Motif 1.2 apps should compile and run out of the
box, whilst 2.1 still has very little functionality.

Note: The version given here is no official lesstif release... it is constructed from a
lesstif CVS snapshot plus various patches to make it usable/stable, sort of.
Hopefully, a future official lesstif release will replace this.

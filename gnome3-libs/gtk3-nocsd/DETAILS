           SHORT="hack to disable gtk+ 3 client side decoration"
cat << EOF
gtk3-nocsd is a small module used to disable the client side decoration of
GTK+3.

Since GTK+ 3.10, its developers added a so-called header bar or custom title
bar. With this and the client-side decoration, the original title bar and window
border provided by the window manager are disabled by gtk+. This makes all GTK+3
programs look like align. Even worse, this may break some window manager or
compositors.

Unfortunately, the GTK+ developers decided to be against the existing standards
and provide "no option" to turn it off.

Luckily, with gtk3-nocsd, we still have a way to (partially) turn it off.

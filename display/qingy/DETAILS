cat << EOF
Qingy is a DirectFB based agetty replacement.
The graphical effects are obtained using the frame-buffer, thus
avoiding the nuisance of running an X server just to login as it
happens with the various *DMs. Also, it has some nice features, such as
text sessions as well as X sessions, screensavers, themes to customize
and an experimental locking feature.

Splashy is a next generation boot splashing system for Unix-like systems.
Unlike other splashing systems, it needs no patches to the kernel.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Install Splashy as you normally would (see INSTALL)

2. Add "splash vga=791 quiet" to the append= line on your bootloader
configuration
   NOTE: For Grub, this is /boot/grub/menu.lst
   For lilo you need "vga=791" in its own line before the kernel stanzas,
   and add
   only "quiet splash" to append=
   Other bootloaders will use the same options, but they need to be passed
   differently. Check your bootloader's manual

3. Make sure that /etc/init.d/runlevels/%S/splashy is installed.

4. Reboot and have fun!

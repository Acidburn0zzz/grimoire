Those modules are still in heavy development and testing.

mod_archive implements XEP-0136 version 0.6 except otr (off-the-record).

Usually Jabber clients can store the conversations in the user hard drive.
But sometimes this isn't possible or affordable, for example when using a
mobile phone, or in a public access machine. XEP-0136 proposes that the
Jabber server archives the messages as they pass through the server, if
the Jabber client requested it. Later, the client can request to the server
the messages. As a summary, mod_archive allows a Jabber client to request
the server to store his own conversations, and later request them.

There are three different versions of this module. The main difference
between them is the storage method:

    * mod_archive uses Mnesia (old)
    * mod_archive_sql uses PostgreSQL (old)
    * mod_archive_odbc uses MySQL or SQLite3, and includes other improvements

There is also the module mod_archive_webview which is a web interface to
mod_archive_odbc (for vieweing the logs)

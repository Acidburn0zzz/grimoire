Features for admin

    * No need to install an additional web server, database, libraries,
      or programs: it uses ejabberd's embedded http service and Erlang's
      internal database.
    * Page in Web Admin that lists registered users and
      their options.
    * Page in Web Admin with usage statistics: options, and
      icon themes. Includes raw number and percentages.
    * Customizable port and URL base path.
    * Possibility to restrict usage to only some users.
    * Easy to add more icon themes: just copy the files to the proper
      directory.
    * Fully translatable both the admin and the user messages.
    * Support for virtual hosts and clustering.
    * Highly scalable: each registered user is a register in the
      table. Other solutions based on bots are limited to only
      a few hundreds or thousands of registered users.
    * Published under the GPL license: you can inspect the source code,
      modify and compile. It's Open Source and Free Sofware.

      and status text.
    * Publish the status text of your presence.
    * Publish and image that reflects your current presence.
    * Many different icon themes, by different authors and sources.
    * You can define the default icon theme you want to use, or specify
      a specific one in the URL.

Written by Bob SchlÃ¤rmann, this panel plugin shows the current temperature and
weather condition, using weather data provided by xoap.weather.com.

To find your location code:

    * Go to www.weather.com
    * Do a search for the area you want to have data for
    * If you get a match, your location code is in the link. It's the part from
      "travel/local" to the "?" in the link. For example: With
      http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/local/NLXX0019?from=search_city
      NLXX0019 is the location code.

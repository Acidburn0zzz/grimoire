The Thunar Volume Manager is an extension for the Thunar file manager, 
which enables automatic management of removable drives and media. For 
example, if thunar-volman is installed and configured properly, and you 
plug in your digital camera, it will automatically launch your preferred 
photo application and import the new pictures from the camera into your 
photo collection.

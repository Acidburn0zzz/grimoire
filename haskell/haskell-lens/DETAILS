This package comes "Batteries Included" with many useful lenses for the types
commonly used from the Haskell Platform, and with tools for automatically
generating lenses and isomorphisms for user-supplied data types.

The combinators in Control.Lens provide a highly generic toolbox for composing
families of getters, folds, isomorphisms, traversals, setters and lenses
and their indexed variants.

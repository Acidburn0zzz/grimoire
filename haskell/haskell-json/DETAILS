cat << EOF
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It
is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and
generate.  It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language,
Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999.

This library provides a parser and pretty printer for converting between
Haskell values and JSON.

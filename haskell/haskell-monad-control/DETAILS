Description: This package defines the type class @MonadBaseControl@, a
subset of @MonadBase@ into which generic control operations such as @catch@
can be lifted from @IO@ or any other base monad. Instances are based on
monad transformers in @MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad
transformers in the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.

See the @lifted-base@ package which uses @monad-control@ to lift @IO@
operations from the @base@ library (like @catch@ or @bracket@) into any
monad that is an instance of @MonadBase@ or @MonadBaseControl@.

Note that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's @monad-peel@
library. The main difference is that this package provides CPS style operators
and exploits the @RankNTypes@ and @TypeFamilies@ language extensions to
simplify and speedup most definitions.

The following @criterion@ based benchmark shows that @monad-control@ is on
average about 99% faster than @monad-peel@:

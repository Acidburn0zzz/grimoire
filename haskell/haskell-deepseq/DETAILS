cat << EOF
This package provides methods for fully evaluating data structures ("deep
evaluation"). Deep evaluation is often used for adding strictness to a
program, e.g. in order to force pending exceptions, remove space leaks, or
force lazy I/O to happen. It is also useful in parallel programs, to ensure
pending work does not migrate to the wrong thread.

The primary use of this package is via the 'deepseq' function, a "deep"
version of 'seq'. It is implemented on top of an 'NFData' typeclass ("Normal
Form Data", data structures with no unevaluated components) which defines
strategies for fully evaluating different data types.

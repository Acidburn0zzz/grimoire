cat << EOF
This library implements the SHA suite of message digest functions, according
to NIST FIPS 180-2 (with the SHA-224 addendum), as well as the SHA-based
HMAC routines. The functions have been tested against most of the NIST and
RFC test vectors for the various functions. While some attention has been
paid to performance, these do not presently reach the speed of well-tuned
libraries, like OpenSSL.

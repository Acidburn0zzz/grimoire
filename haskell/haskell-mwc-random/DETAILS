cat << EOF
This package contains code for generating high quality random numbers that
follow either a uniform or normal distribution. The generated numbers are
suitable for use in statistical applications.

The uniform PRNG uses Marsaglia's MWC256 (also known as MWC8222)
multiply-with-carry generator, which has a period of 2^8222 and fares well
in tests of randomness. It is also extremely fast, between 2 and 3 times
faster than the Mersenne Twister.

Compared to the mersenne-random package, this package has a more convenient
API, is faster, and supports more statistical distributions.

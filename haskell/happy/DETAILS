cat << EOF
Happy is a parser generator system for Haskell, similar to the tool 'yacc'
for C. Like 'yacc', it takes a file containing an annotated BNF specification
of a grammar and produces a Haskell module containing a parser for the grammar.

Happy is flexible: you can have several Happy parsers in the same program,
and several entry points to a single grammar. Happy can work in conjunction
with a lexical analyser supplied by the user (either hand-written or generated
by another program), or it can parse a stream of characters directly (but
this isn't practical in most cases).

As of version 1.5, Happy is capable of parsing full Haskell. We have a
Haskell parser that uses Happy, which will shortly be part of the library
collection distributed with GHC.

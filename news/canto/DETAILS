Canto is an Atom/RSS feed reader for the console that is meant to be quick,
concise, and colorful. It's meant to allow you to crank through feeds like
you've never cranked before by providing a minimal, yet information packed
interface. No navigating menus. No dense blocks of unreadable white text. An
interface with almost infinite customization and extensibility using the
excellent Python programming language.

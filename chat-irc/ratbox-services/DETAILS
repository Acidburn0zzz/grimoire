ratbox-services is a services package written mostly from scratch for use with
ircd-ratbox.

It is highly configurable, with nearly all options being set in a config that
can be rehashed rather than set at compile time. It also uses the SQLite
database backend, which works as a database interface to a normal file, meaning
no separate database software must be running.

MySQL and PostgreSQL backends are also supported.

Minbif aims to use the libpurple library from the Pidgin project to provide an
IRC-friendly instant messaging client.

Minbif is an IRC gateway to IM networks which provides the following features:

  - Minbif uses a library which abstracts all IM calls, and has several plugins
      to support more than 15 IM protocols (IRC included!);
  - Two modes: inetd and daemon fork;
  - Only IRC commands are used to control Minbif;
  - IM Certificates check;
  - Buddies are IRC users;
  - Each account has a status channel. You see in all connected buddies, and
      their status on it;
  - Add and remove buddies from list with /INVITE and /KICK commands;
  - Blocked users are bans on the account's status channel;
  - Display when a buddy is typing a message;
  - Can chat with someone who is not in your buddy list;
  - You can see buddies' icons (with libcaca) or download them;
  - DCC SEND an image to set your icon on IM networks;
  - Display extended information about buddies with /WII command;
  - Support away messages;
  - Can send and receive files, which are sent or received to/from your IRC
      client with DCC SEND;
  - Conversation channels are supported;
  - Auto-rejoin conversation channels at connection;
  - Display list of channels on an IM account with /LIST;
  - irssi scripts to increase your user experience of minbif;
  - CACAcam (webcam in ascii art).
  - CoinCoin plugin for libpurple.
  - PAM support
  - TLS support with certificate auth (released soon)

Ii creates an irc directory tree with server, channel and nick name directories.
In every directory a FIFO in file and a normal out file is created.

The in file is used to communicate with the servers and the out files contain
the server messages. For every channel and every nick name there are related
in and out files created. This allows IRC communication from command line
and adheres to the Unix philosophy.

CtrlProxy runs on a computer with a 24/7 internet connection and allows you to
transparently connect to IRC from anywhere on the world to your nick. It
connects to one or more IRC servers and then allows you to connect to it with
any number of clients, providing access to these servers. This is very useful if
you don't want to leave IRC but still want to be able to use it from home,
school or work.

cat << EOF
libstree is a generic suffix tree implementation, written in C. It can
handle arbitrary data structures as elements of a string. Unlike most demo
implementations, it is not limited to simple ASCII character strings. Suffix
tree generation in libstree is highly efficient and implemented using the
algorithm by Ukkonen. This means that libstree builds suffix trees in time
linear to the length of the strings, assuming that string element comparisons
can be done in constant time.

libstree can handle multiple strings per suffix tree, including dynamic
insertion and removal of strings. It provides various means of obtaining
information about nodes in the tree, such as depth-first and breadth-first
iteration, leaves iteration, and bottom-up iteration. libstree provides
implementations of longest-common-substring and longest-repeated-substring
algorithms, as examples of how to build complex algorithms using the suffix
tree primitives.

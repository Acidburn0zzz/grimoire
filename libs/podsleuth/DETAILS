PodSleuth is a tool to discover detailed model information about an Apple (TM)
iPod (TM). Its primary role is to be run as a callout by HAL [1] because root
access is needed to scan the device for required information. When the model
information is discovered, it is merged into HAL as properties for other
applications to use.

With PodSleuth installed, applications can expect to have rich iPod (TM)
metadata merged into the device tree on the iPod data volume node. PodSleuth
metadata properties are in the org.banshee-project.podsleuth namespace.

PodSleuth is based on lessons learned from the old libipoddevice [2] project.
It is a cumulation of 2 years of research, backwards and forwards device
compatibility, and extensive device coverage and user testing. It deprecates
the libipoddevice project in use and simplifies information access for
top level applications.

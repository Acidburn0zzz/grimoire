cat << EOF
Tslib is an abstraction layer for touchscreen panel events, as well as a filter
stack for the manipulation of those events. It was created by Russell King, of
arm.linux.org.uk. Examples of implemented filters include jitter smoothing and
the calibration transform.

Tslib is generally used on embedded devices to provide a common user space
interface to touchscreen functionality. It is supported by Kdrive (aka TinyX)
and OPIE as well as being used on a number of commercial Linux devices
including the Nokia 770.

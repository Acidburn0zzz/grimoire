girara is a library that implements a user interface that focuses on simplicity
and minimalism. It consists of three main components: The view is a widget that
represents the actual application (e.g.: a web site or a document). The input
bar is used to execute commands of the application, while the status bar
notifies the user with current information. It is designed to replace and the
enhance the user interface that is used by zathura and jumanji.

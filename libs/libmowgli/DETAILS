cat << EOF
mowgli is a development framework for C (like GLib), which
provides high performance and highly flexible algorithms.
It can be used as a suppliment to GLib (to add additional
functions (dictionaries, hashes), or replace some of the
slow GLib list manipulation functions), or stand alone. It
also provides a powerful hook system and convenient logging
for your code, as well as a high performance block allocator.

mowgli builds upon previous attempts, such as libmisc, and
will likely become the primary development framework for most
projects at Atheme.

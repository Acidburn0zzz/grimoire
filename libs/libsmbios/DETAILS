SMBIOS is a standards-based approach for hardware vendors to
present and structure management data for consumption by OS and
Management Applications. You can find more information here:
http://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios .

Basically, the system BIOS leaves a small table in memory that can be found
by the OS after system boot. This table has a standardized format that can
easily be parsed by application software.

Several Dell-specific hardware features, such as BIOS update, CMOS Tokens,
SMI, hardware probes (temperature, fan, etc) are represented in the SMBIOS
tables. Because of this, libsmbios has code to enable these features on
Dell systems.

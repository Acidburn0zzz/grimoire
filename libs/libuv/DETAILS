  * Full-featured event loop backed by epoll, kqueue, IOCP, event ports.
  * Asynchronous TCP and UDP sockets
  * Asynchronous DNS resolution
  * Asynchronous file and file system operations
  * File system events
  * ANSI escape code controlled TTY
  * IPC with socket sharing, using Unix domain sockets or named pipes (Windows)
  * Child processes
  * Thread pool
  * Signal handling
  * High resolution clock
  * Threading and synchronization primitives

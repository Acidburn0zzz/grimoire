I/O. It was primarily developed for use by Node.js, but it's also used by
Mozilla's Rust language, Luvit, Julia, pyuv, and others.

 * Full-featured event loop backed by epoll, kqueue, IOCP, event ports.  *
 Asynchronous TCP and UDP sockets * Asynchronous DNS resolution * Asynchronous
 file and file system operations * File system events * ANSI escape code
 controlled TTY * IPC with socket sharing, using Unix domain sockets or
 named pipes (Windows) * Child processes * Thread pool * Signal handling *
 High resolution clock * Threading and synchronization primitives

cat << EOF
libmemcached is a C and C++ client library to the memcached server. It has been
designed to be light on memory usage, thread safe, and provide full access to
server side methods.

A few notes on its design:
* Synchronous and Asynchronous support.
* TCP and Unix Socket protocols.
* A half dozen or so different hash algorithms.
* Implementations of the new cas, replace, and append operators.
* Man pages written up on entire API.
* Implements both modulo and consistent hashing solutions.

It also implements several command line tools:

memcat - Copy the value of a key to standard output.
memflush - Flush the contents of your servers.
memrm - Remove a key(s) from the serrver.
memcp - Copy files to a memached server.
memstat - Dump the stats of your servers to standard output.
memslap - Generate testing loads on a memcached cluster.

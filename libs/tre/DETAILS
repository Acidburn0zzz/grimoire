cat << EOF
TRE is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant regexp matching
library with some exciting features such as approximate (fuzzy) matching.
At the core of TRE is a new algorithm for regular expression matching with
submatch addressing.

Features

TRE is not just yet another regexp matcher. TRE has some features which are not
there in most free POSIX compatible implementations. Most of these features are
not present in non-free implementations either, for that matter.

* Approximate matching
* Strict standard conformance
* Predictable matching speed
* Predictable and modest memory consumption
* Wide character and multibyte character set support
* Binary pattern and data support
* Completely thread safe
* Portable
* Free

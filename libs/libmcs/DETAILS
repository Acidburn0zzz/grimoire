mcs is a library and set of userland tools which abstract the
storage of configuration settings away from userland applications.

It is hoped that by using mcs, that the applications which
use it will generally have a more congruent feeling in regards
to settings.

There have been other projects like this before (such as GConf),
but unlike those projects, mcs strictly handles abstraction. It
does not impose any specific data storage requirement, nor is it
tied to any desktop environment or software suite.

Because mcs is licenced under the BSD licence, it is hoped that
many applications will adopt it's use.

cat << EOF
Libdnsres provides a non-blocking, thread-safe API for resolving
DNS names. It requires that your main application is built on top of
libevent. The API essentially mirrors the traditional gethostbyname and
getaddrinfo interfaces. All return values have been replaced by callbacks
instead. The code borrows heavily from the BSD resolver library. In fact,
it is an extremely ugly hack to make the BSD resolver library non-blocking
and thread-safe without changing the API too much.
 Although it has not been tested heavily, it
should compile on BSD systems and Linux. The library comes with a simple
test program that can be use to verify if it works correctly.

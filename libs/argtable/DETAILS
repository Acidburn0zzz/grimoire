cat << EOF
Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line options with a
minimum of fuss. It enables a program's command line syntax to be defined in the
source code as an array of argtable structs. The command line is then parsed
according to that specification and the resulting values are returned in those
same structs where they are accessible to the main program. Both tagged (-v,
--verbose, --foo=bar) and untagged arguments are supported, as are multiple
instances of each argument. Syntax error handling is automatic and the library
also provides the means for generating a textual description of the command line
syntax.

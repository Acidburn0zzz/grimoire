htmlcxx is a simple non-validating css1 and html parser for C++. Although there
are several other html parsers available, htmlcxx has some characteristics
that make it unique:

* STL like navigation of DOM tree, using excelent's tree.hh library from
  Kasper Peeters
* It is possible to reproduce exactly, character by character, the original
  document from the parse tree
* Bundled css parser
* Optional parsing of attributes
* C++ code that looks like C++ (not so true anymore)
* Offsets of tags/elements in the original document are stored in the nodes
  of the DOM tree

The parsing politics of htmlcxx were created trying to mimic mozilla firefox
(http://www.mozilla.org) behavior. So you should expect parse trees similar
to those create by firefox. However, differently from firefox, htmlcxx does
not insert non-existent stuff in your html. Therefore, serializing the DOM
tree gives exactly the same bytes contained in the original HTML document.

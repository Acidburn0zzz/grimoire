Fast and lightweight 2D rigid body physics library in C

Features:
    * Designed with 2D video games in mind.
    * Circle, convex polygon, and beveled line segment collision primitives.
    * Multiple collision primitives can be attached to a single rigid body.
    * Fast broad phase collision detection by using a spatial hash.
    * Extremely fast impulse solving by utilizing Erin Catto's contact
    persistence algorithm.
    * Support for collision callbacks based on user definable object types.
    * Flexible collision detection system with layers, exclusion groups and
    event based callbacks.
    * Supports point and segment (raycasting) queries to the collision
    detection system.
    * Impulses applied to contact points can be retrieved after the impulse
    solver has finished for gameplay effects.
    * Several kinds of joints and constraints available along with an API
    for easily adding new kinds of constraints.
    * Lightweight C99 implementation with no external dependencies outside
    of the Std. C library.
    * Many language bindings available.
    * Simple, read the documentation and see!
    * Unrestrictive MIT license.
    * Makes you smarter, stronger and more attractive to the opposite gender!

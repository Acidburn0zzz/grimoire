cat << EOF
The libcap-ng library is intended to make programming with posix capabilities
much easier than the traditional libcap library. It includes utilities that can
analyse all currently running applications and print out any capabilities and
whether or not it has an open ended bounding set. An open bounding set without
the securebits "NOROOT" flag will allow full capabilities escalation for apps
retaining uid 0 simply by calling execve.

The included utilities are designed to let admins and developers spot apps from
various ways that may be running with too much privilege. For example, any
investigation should start with network facing apps since they would be prime
targets for intrusion. The netcap program will check all running apps and
display the results.

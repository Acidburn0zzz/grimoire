AqBanking is a library for online banking and financial
applications. It has three major goals which are described in the
following paragraphs.

Generic Online Banking Interface
-------------------------------------------------------

The intention of AqBanking is to provide a middle layer between the program
and the various Online Banking libraries (e.g. AqHBCI, OpenHBCI etc).

The real work is done in so-called banking backends. See chapter 4 for a
list of supported backends.

Generic Financial Data Importer/Exporter Framework
-------------------------------------------------------

AqBanking uses various plugins to simplify import and export of financial
data. It also provides the administration of profiles on a per import/export
plugin basis.

Currently there are plugins for the following formats:

- Importers:
  - DTAUS (German financial format)
  - SWIFT (MT940 and MT942)
  - OFX
  - CSV
  - OpenHBCI1 transactions
  - ERI

- Exporters
  - DTAUS (German financial format)
  - CSV

Bank/Account Information
-----------------------------

AqBanking supports plugins which allow lookup and verification of
bank code/ account id pair validity. For Germany the library
KtoBlzCheck is used for validation, but the bank information is
shipped with aqbanking.

Currently AqBanking provides informations about:
- ca 25,000 US banks
- ca 20,000 German banks
- ca  3,600 Swiss banks
- ca  2,300 Austrian banks

AqBanking also provides information about countries: Country name, ISO-3166
country code (both numeric and alpha) and currency information (ISO 4217
currency codes).

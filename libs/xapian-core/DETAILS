Xapian is a search engine library, scalable to collections containing hundreds
of millions of documents. It's written in C++ with bindings for Perl, Python,
PHP, Java, Tcl, C#, and Ruby. It is a highly adaptable toolkit that allows
developers to easily add advanced indexing and search facilities to their
own applications. It supports the Probabilistic Information Retrieval model
as well as a rich set of boolean query operators. Omega is a Web search
application built upon the Xapian library. It can index a Web server's
document tree (including HTML, PDF, OpenOffice, MS Word/Excel/Powerpoint,
etc.), or data exported from arbitrary sources (e.g. SQL databases).

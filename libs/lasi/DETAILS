cat << EOF
libLASi is a library written by Larry Siden that provides a C++ stream output
interface ( with operator << ) for creating Postscript documents that can
contain characters from any of the scripts and symbol blocks supported in
Unicode and by Owen Taylor's Pango layout engine. The library accomodates
right-to-left scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew as easily as left-to-right
scripts. Indic and Indic-derived Complex Text Layout (CTL) scripts, such as
Devanagari, Thai, Lao, and Tibetan are supported to the extent provided by
Pango and by the OpenType fonts installed on your system. All of this is
provided without need for any special configuration or layout calculation
on the programmer's part.

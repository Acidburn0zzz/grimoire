Vc is a free software library to ease explicit vectorization of C++ code. It has an intuitive 
API and provides portability between different compilers and compiler versions as well as 
portability between different vector instruction sets. Thus an application written with Vc can 
be compiled for 
AVX
SSE2 up to SSE4.2
SSE4a, XOP, and FMA4
Scalar (fallback which works everywhere)
LRBni support disabled, waiting for MIC

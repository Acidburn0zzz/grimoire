libusbx is a library that provides generic access to USB devices. It is meant
to be used by developers, to facilitate the development of applications that
communicate with USB hardware.

It is user-mode: No special privilege or elevation is required for the
application to communicate with a device.

It is version-agnostic: All versions of the USB protocol, from 1.0 to 3.0
(latest), are supported.

It is a fork of libusb, meant to be a drop-in replacement, with more features
and a faster release cycle.

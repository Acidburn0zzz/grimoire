PoDoFo is a C++ library to work with the PDF file format. It also includes also
a few tools. It includes classes to parse a PDF file, modify its contents in
memory, write the changes back to disk, and create new PDF files. The PoDoFo
tools are simple tools built around the PoDoFo library.  These tools are
primarily examples of how to use the PoDoFo library in your own projects,
although they offer useful features for working with PDF files.

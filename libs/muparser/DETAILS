cat << EOF
Many applications require the parsing of mathematical expressions. The
main objective of this project is to provide a fast and easy way of doing
this. muParser is an extensible high performance math parser library. It
is based on transforming an expression into a bytecode and precalculating
constant parts of it.

The math parser library is written in pure C++ and should compile on every
standard compliant compiler. I provide you with static libraries and a DLL
version ready for implementation into your projects. The code has been tested
using MS VC++ V7.1 and GCC V3.3.1. It reportedly works on BCB too. I provide
you with three demo projects in order to help you understand its usage.

Gavl is short for Gmerlin Audio Video Library. It is a low level library,
upon which multimedia APIs can be built. Gavl handles all the details of
audio and video formats like colorspaces, samplerates, multichannel
configurations etc. It provides standardized definitions for those formats
as well as container structures for carrying audio samples or video images
inside an application.

In addition, it handles the sometimes ugly task to convert between all
these formats and provides some elementary operations (copying, scaling,
alpha blending etc).

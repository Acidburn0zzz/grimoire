cat << EOF
libasr is a free, simple and portable asynchronous resolver library.

It allows to run DNS queries and perform hostname resolutions in a fully
asynchronous fashion. The implementation is thread-less, fork-less, and does
not make use of signals or other "tricks" that might get in the developer's way.
The API was initially developped for the OpenBSD operating system, where it is
natively supported.

This library is intended to bring this interface to other systems. It is
originally provided as a support library for the portable version of the
OpenSMTPD daemon, but it can be used in any other contexts.

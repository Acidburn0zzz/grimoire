SHORT="a library that abstracts the control group filesystem in linux"
cat << EOF
libcg aims to provide programmers easily usable APIs to use the control group
file system. It should satisfy the following requirements
 * Provide a programmable interface for cgroups
This should allow applications to create cgroups using something like
create_cgroup() as opposed to having to go the whole filesystem route.
 * Provide persistent configuration across reboots
Control Groups have a lifetime of only one boot cycle. The configuration is lost
at reboot. Userspace needs to handle this issue. This is handled by libcg
 * Provide a programmable interface for manipulating configurations
This should allow libcg to handle changing application requirements. For
example, while gaming, you might want to reduce the cpu power of other groups
whereas othertimes you would want greater CPU power for those groups.

cat << EOF
BoolStuff is a C++ library that supports a few operations on boolean expression
binary trees. The main features are:

    * a simple boolean expression parser (supports operators AND, OR
      and NOT, as well as parentheses);
    * an algorithm to convert a boolean expression binary tree into
      its Disjunctive Normal Form (this algorithm supports the NOT operator);
    * a function that determines if an expression tree is in DNF.

A command named booldnf that calls this library to convert an expression to
the DNF is also provided.

cat << EOF
The BioAPI Specification is intended to provide a high-level generic biometric
authentication model, one suited for any form of biometric technology. It
covers the basic functions of Enrollment, Verification, and Identification, and
includes a database interface to allow a biometric service provider (BSP) to
manage the Identification population for optimum performance. It also provides
primitives that allow the application to manage the capture of samples on a
client, and the Enrollment, Verification, and Identification on a server. This
is an unofficial fork of the reference implementation of the standard.

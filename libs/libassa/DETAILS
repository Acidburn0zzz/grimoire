cat << EOF
 libASSA is an object-oriented C++ networking library based on Adaptive
Communication Patterns. It features a simplistic implementation of the
set of communication patterns such as Service Configurator, Reactor,
Acceptor, Connector, and others described in various papers published by
Dr. D. C. Schmidt. You can find them here.

libASSA happily co-exists with other frameworks such as GUI toolkits and
various CORBA implementations.

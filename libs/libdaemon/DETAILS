cat << EOF
libdaemon is a lightweight C library which eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
It consists of the following parts:

* A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization procedure of a
  process
* A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to Syslog or
  STDERR
* An API for writing PID files
* An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with select() or
  poll()

Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
is not that simple to get it done right and code duplication cannot be a goal.

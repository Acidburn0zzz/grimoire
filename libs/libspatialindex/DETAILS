cat << EOF
The purpose of this library is to provide:

1. An extensible framework that will support robust spatial indexing methods.
2. Support for sophisticated spatial queries. Range, point location, nearest
   neighbor and k-nearest neighbor as well as parametric queries (defined
   by spatial constraints) should be easy to deploy and run.
3. Easy to use interfaces for inserting, deleting and updating information.
4. Wide variety of customization capabilities. Basic index and storage
   characteristics like the page size, node capacity, minimum fan-out,
   splitting algorithm, etc. should be easy to customize.
5. Index persistence. Internal memory and external memory structures should be
   supported. Clustered and non-clustered indices should be easy to be
   persisted.

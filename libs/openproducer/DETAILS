cat << EOF
Open Producer (or simply Producer) is a cross-platform, C++ library for
managing OpenGL rendering
contexts in a windowing system independent manner.  Producer provides a
simple, yet powerfully
scalable approach for real-time 3D applications wishing to run within a
single window to large,
multidisplay systems.
 Producer is highly  portable and has been tested on Linux, Windows, Mac OSX,
 Solaris and IRIX.
Producer works on all Unix based OS's (including Mac OSX) through the X11
Windowing system, and
through the native win32 on Windows.
 Producer is written with productivity, performance and scalability in mind
 by adhering to industry
standard and employing advanced software engineering practices.  Software
developers wishing to
produce 3D rendering software that can display on a desktop, and move to a
large system or clustered
system of displays by simply changing a configuration file, can depend on
Open Producer to handle all
the complexity for them.

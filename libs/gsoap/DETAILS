The gSOAP toolkit provides a cross-platform software development toolkit for C
and C++ server and client Web service applications, and simplifies the overall
use of XML in any type of application. The toolkit supports SOAP 1.1/1.2 RPC
encoding and document/literal styles, WSDL 1.1, MTOM/MIME/DIME attachments
(streaming), SOAP-over-UDP, request-response and one-way messaging. The toolkit
also supports WS-Addressing and WS-Security, with several other WS-* available
or under development. See the official open-source gSOAP website

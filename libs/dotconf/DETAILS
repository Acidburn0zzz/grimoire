cat << EOF
dot.conf is a simple configuration-file parser library written in C. The
configuration files created for dot.conf look very similar to those used by the
Apache Webserver. Even Container-Directives known from httpd.conf can easily be
used in the exact same manner as for Apache-Modules. It supports various types
of arguments, dynamically loadable modules that create their own configuration
options on-the-fly, a here-documents feature to pass very long ARG_STR data to
your app, ${NAME:-default} style environment variable substitution for
arguments, and on-the-fly inclusion of additional config files. Some behaviour
can be toggled with flags at runtime. To keep dotconf from printing out
warnings, you can install your own customized errorhandler.

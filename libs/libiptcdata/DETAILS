ibiptcdata is a library, written in C, for manipulating the International Press
Telecommunications Council (IPTC) metadata stored within multimedia files such 
as images. This metadata can include captions and keywords, often used by 
popular photo management applications. The library provides routines for 
parsing, viewing, modifying, and saving this metadata. The library is licensed 
under the GNU Library General Public License (GNU LGPL). The libiptcdata package
also includes a command-line utility, iptc, for editing IPTC data in JPEG files,
as well as Python bindings.

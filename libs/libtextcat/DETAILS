cat << EOF
Libtextcat is a library with functions that implement the classification
technique described in Cavnar &amp; Trenkle, &quot;N-Gram-Based Text
Categorization&quot;. It was primarily developed for language guessing, a task
on which it is known to perform with near- perfect accuracy.  Considerable
effort went into making this implementation fast and efficient. The language
guesser processes over 100 documents/second on a simple PC, which makes it
practical for many uses.

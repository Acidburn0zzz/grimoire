Mini-XML is a small XML parsing library that you can use to read XML and
XML-like data files in your application without requiring large non-standard
libraries.

Mini-XML provides the following functionality:

 * Reading of UTF-8 and UTF-16 and writing of UTF-8 encoded XML files and 
   strings.
 * Data is stored in a linked-list tree structure, preserving the XML data 
   hierarchy.
 * Supports arbitrary element names, attributes, and attribute values with no 
   preset limits, just available memory.
 * Supports integer, real, opaque ("cdata"), and text data types in "leaf" 
   nodes.
 * Functions for creating, indexing, and managing trees of data.
 * "Find" and "walk" functions for easily locating and navigating trees of 
   data.

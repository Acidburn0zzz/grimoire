This is the the client and protocol library for the Drizzle project. The server, drizzled, will 
use this as for the protocol library, as well as the client utilities and any new projects that 
require low-level protocol communication (like proxies). Other language interfaces (PHP 
extensions, SWIG, ...) should be built off of this interface.

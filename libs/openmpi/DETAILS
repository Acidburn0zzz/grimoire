The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that is developed and 
maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners. Open MPI 
is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources from all 
across the High Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI 
library available. Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors, 
application developers and computer science researchers.

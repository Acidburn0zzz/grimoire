The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that is
developed and
maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners. Open
MPI
is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources
from all
across the High Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI
library available. Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors,
application developers and computer science researchers.

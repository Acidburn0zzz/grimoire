cat << EOF
ELFIO is a C++ library for reading and generating files in the ELF binary
format. This library is unique and not based on any other product. It is also
platform independent. The library uses standard ANSI C++ constructions and runs
on a wide variety of architectures.

While the library's implementation does make your work easier: a basic
knowledge of the ELF binary format is required. Information about ELF is
included in the TIS (Tool Interface Standards) documentation you received with
the library's source code.

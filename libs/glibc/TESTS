2.5 Works fine on (2.3.6 on kernel 2.4 unchanged, so doesn't need testing):
ARCH         | Flags                          | compiler  | tester        | note
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
athlon-xp    | combreloc speedy strip         | gcc 4.1.2 | lynx          |

2.6.1 Works fine on:
ARCH         | Flags                          | compiler  | tester        | note
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
athlon-xp    | tiny                           | gcc 4.1.2 | p3pilot       | originally had problem with GLIBC_ARCH not being set in PRE_BUILD.  First install was broke due to an old symbolic link in /usr/include for asm-generic

cat << EOF
osgEarth is a 3D mapping SDK for OpenSceneGraph applications. Itâ€™s different
from traditional terrain engines in an important way: osgEarth does not
require you to build a 3D terrain model before you display it. Instead,
it will access the raw data sources at application run time and composite
them into a 3D map on the fly. No terrain model is actually stored to disk,
though it does use caching techniques to speed up the rendering of the map.

           SHORT="The "findlib" library provides a scheme to manage reusable software components (packages)"
cat << EOF
The "findlib" library provides a scheme to manage reusable software components
(packages), and includes tools that support this scheme. Packages are
collections of OCaml modules for which metainformation can be stored. The
packages are kept in the filesystem hierarchy, but with strict directory
structure. The library contains functions to look the directory up that
stores a package, to query metainformation about a package, and to retrieve
dependency information about multiple packages. There is also a tool that
allows the user to enter queries on the command-line. In order to simplify
compilation and linkage, there are new frontends of the various OCaml
compilers that can directly deal with packages.

Together with the packages metainformation is stored. This includes
a version string, the archives the package consists of, and additional
linker options. Packages can also be dependent on other packages. There is a
query which finds out all predecessors of a list of packages and sorts them
topologically. The new compiler frontends do this implicitly.

Metainformation can be conditional, i.e. depend on a set of predicates. This
is mainly used to be able to react on certain properties of the environment,
such as if the bytecode or the native compiler is invoked, if the application
is multi-threaded, and a few more. If the new compiler frontends are used,
most predicates are found out automatically.

There is special support for scripts. A new directive, "#require", loads
packages into scripts. Of course, this works only with newly created toploops
which include the "findlib" library.

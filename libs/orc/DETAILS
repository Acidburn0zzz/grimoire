ORC is the Oil Runtime Compiler (OIL stands for Optimized Inner Loops).
ORC is the sucessor to Liboil - The Library of Optimized Inner Loops.

ORC is a library and set of tools for compiling and executing
very simple programs that operate on arrays of data.  The "language"
is a generic assembly language that represents many of the features
available in SIMD architectures, including saturated addition and
subtraction, and many arithmetic operations.

libextractor is a library used to extract meta-data from files of arbitrary 
type. It is designed to use helper-libraries to perform the actual extraction,
and to be trivially extendable by linking against external extractors for 
additional file types.

The goal is to provide developers of file-sharing networks or WWW-indexing bots
 with a universal library to obtain simple keywords to match against queries. 
libextractor contains a shell-command "extract" that, similar to the well-known 
"file" command, can extract meta-data from a file an print the results to 
stdout.

Currently, libExtractor supports the following formats: HTML, PDF, PS, OLE2 
(DOC, XLS, PPT), OpenOffice (sxw), StarOffice (sdw), DVI, MAN, MP3 (ID3v1 and 
ID3v2), OGG, WAV, JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, DEB, RPM, TAR(.GZ), ZIP, ELF, REAL, RIFF
(AVI), MPEG, QT and ASF. Also, various additional MIME types are detected.

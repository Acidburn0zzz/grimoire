The Direct Rendering Infrastructure, also known as the DRI, is a framework for allowing direct 
access to graphics hardware under the X Window System in a safe and efficient manner. It includes 
changes to the X server, to several client libraries, and to the kernel (DRM, Direct Rendering 
Manager). The most important use for the DRI is to create fast OpenGL implementations providing 
hardware acceleration for Mesa. Several 3D accelerated drivers have been written to the DRI 
specification, including drivers for chipsets produced by 3DFX, AMD (formerly ATI), Intel and 
Matrox.

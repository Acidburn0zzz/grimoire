libspf2 implements the Sender Policy Framework, a part of the SPF/SRS protocol
pair. libspf2 is a library which allows email systems such as Sendmail, Postfix,
Exim and Zmailer to check SPF records and make sure that the email is authorized
by the domain name that it is coming from. This prevents email forgery, commonly
used by spammers, scammers and email viruses/worms.

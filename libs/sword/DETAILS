The SWORD Project is the CrossWire Bible Society's free Bible software project. 
Its purpose is to create cross-platform open-source tools 
--covered by the GNU General Public License-- that allow programmers and Bible 
societies to write new Bible software more quickly and easily. 
We also create Bible study software for all readers, students, scholars, and translators 
of the Bible, and have a growing collection of over 200 texts in over 50 languages.

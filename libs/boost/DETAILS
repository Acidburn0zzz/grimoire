The Boost web site provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source
libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the
C++ Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice"
and provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries
are suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries
have already been proposed for inclusion in the  C++ Standards
Committee's upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.

Although Boost was begun by members of the C++ Standards Committee
Library Working Group, membership has expanded to include nearly two
thousand members of the C++ community at large.

LibTomPoly is a public domain open source library to provide polynomial basis
arithmetic. It uses the public domain library LibTomMath (not included) for
the integer arithmetic and extends the functonality to provide polynomial
arithmetic.

LibTomPoly has the following features:
* Totally public domain and is only dependent on LibTomMath, another public
  domain library.
* Portable source code.
* Provides access to polynomials of finite characteristic of varying degrees (it
  will grow to accomodate).
* Includes several algebraic operations:
  - Usual addition, subtraction, division, multiplication.
  - Modular versions of the add/sub/mul.
  - Modular exponentiation.
  - Irreducibility testing.
  - Monic reductions.
  - Comparisons.

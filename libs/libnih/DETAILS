cat << EOF
libnih is roughly equivalent to other C libraries such as glib, except that
its focus is on a small size and intended for applications that sit very
low in the software stack, especially outside of /usr.

It expressly does not reimplement functions that already exist in libraries
ordinarily shipped in /lib such libc6, and does not do foolish things like
invent arbitrary typedefs for perfectly good C types.

The overall goal of this project is to make an open source implementation
of the
Object Exchange (OBEX) protocol. OBEX is a session protocol and can best be
described as a
binary HTTP protocol. OBEX is optimised for ad-hoc wireless links and can
be used to exchange all kind
of objects like files, pictures, calendar entries (vCal) and business cards
(vCard).
 OBEX was specified by the IrDATM (Infrared Data Association), and although
 the protocol is very good
for Infrared connections, it is not limited to it. In fact OBEX does not
specify the top or bottom API
making it very flexible and can run over most transports like TCP/IP and
Bluetooth. Therefore OBEX is
also called IrOBEX when used over the Infrared medium. There are some
transport modules for serial
links (cable OBEX) too.

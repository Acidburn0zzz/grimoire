Lightweight X11 session manager derived from XSM.

 LXSession is the default X11 session manager of LXDE.  (LXDE: Lightweight
 X11 Desktop Environment) http://lxde.sourceforge.net/

 Though being part of LXDE, it's totally desktop-independent.  It doesn't
 depend on any desktop environment, and has few dependencies.  The goal
 of this project is to make a simple and clean a X11 session manager which
 isn't tight to any desktop environment.

 We know that GNOME session by default loads GNOME, XFCE4 session by default
 loads XFCE, and what will LXSession load then?  "It's all up to you." You can
 give it a list of applications you want to launch, including window manager
 and other components of a regular desktop environment should have. Then,
 give this combination a new name, and you can have "your own custom
 desktop environment" now.  At the end of this README file, there will be
 a tutorial telling you how to create your own new desktop environment. So,
 be patient. :-)

 By default LXSession ships with a set of config files giving you a new
 desktop environment called LXDE. When you choose LXDE in GDM, KDM, or
 simply execute startlxde in xinitrc, When launching, LXDE will load icewm
 (window manager), pcmanfm (file manager), and lxpanel (desktop panel).
 This, of course, can be changed, but I guess users will be intrested in
 creating their own new customized DE.

 Check these files with text editors to see how LXSession works.  These files
 define a default session named LXDE: /usr/share/xsessions/LXDE.desktop:
 Add an entry in GDM & KDM /usr/bin/startlxde: Convinient script launching
 LXDE /etc/LXSM-LXDE-Default: Default programs loaded when LXDE is started,
 containing window manager, desktop panel...etc.

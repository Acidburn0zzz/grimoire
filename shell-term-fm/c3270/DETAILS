c3270 is a curses based IBM 3270 terminal emulator.
(If you don't know what an IBM 3270 terminal emulator is, then you probably
don't need c3270).

c3270 runs over a TELNET connection (with or without TN3270E) and emulates either an
IBM 3279 (color) or 3278 (monochrome). It supports APL2 characters, IND$FILE file
transfer, NVT mode, a pop-up keypad for 3270-specific keys, a scrollbar, and has
extensive debugging and scripting facilities.
c3270 is distributed as source code, and can be used for free.

Hotwire is an object-oriented hypershell. It is a shell designed for systems
programming (files, processes), and thus it is in the same conceptual
category of software as the Unix shell+terminal and Windows PowerShell.

The goal of the Hotwire project though is to create a better systems
programming shell than both Unix and PowerShell. We call it a hyper-shell
because Hotwire blends the concepts of a systems-oriented shell with a modern
graphical user interface display. It takes advantage of your desktop
environment rather than being a text box. It retains some advantageous
attributes of a shell such as keyboard command orientation, interactivity,
completion, and scripting.

From an implementation perspective, at the heart of Hotwire is the concept of
asynchronous object-oriented pipeline processing. Layered on top of this in a
tightly integrated fashion is a graphical display, control and introspection
system.

cat << EOF
gentoo is a modern, powerful, flexible, and utterly configurable file manager
for UNIX systems, written using the GTK+ toolkit. It aims to be 100%
graphically configurable; there's no need to edit config files by hand and
then restart the application. gentoo is somewhat inspired in its look & feel
by the classic Amiga program DirectoryOpus. It has been successfully tested
on a variety of platforms, including Linux/x86, Linux/Alpha, Solaris, FreeBSD
and OpenBSD.
gentoo is not affiliated with Gentoo Linux distribution, and in fact was
announced under this name earlier than this distribution.

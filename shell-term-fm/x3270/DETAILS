x3270 is an IBM 3270 terminal emulator for the X Window System.
(If you don't know what an IBM 3270 terminal emulator is, then you probably
don't need x3270).

x3270 runs over a TELNET connection (with or without TN3270E) and emulates
either an
IBM 3279 (color) or 3278 (monochrome). It supports APL2 characters,
IND$FILE file
transfer, NVT mode, a pop-up keypad for 3270-specific keys, a scrollbar,
and has
extensive debugging and scripting facilities.
It also has a novel "active icon" mode that updates the icon image as
the screen
image changes, and even does a fair job of emulating a color xterm. It does not
yet support graphics. x3270 is distributed as source code, and can be used
for free.

x3270 is an IBM 3270 terminal emulator for the X Window System.  
(If you don't know what an IBM 3270 terminal emulator is, then you probably 
don't need x3270).  

x3270 runs over a TELNET connection (with or without TN3270E) and emulates either an 
IBM 3279 (color) or 3278 (monochrome). It supports APL2 characters, IND$FILE file 
transfer, NVT mode, a pop-up keypad for 3270-specific keys, a scrollbar, and has 
extensive debugging and scripting facilities.  
It also has a novel "active icon" mode that updates the icon image as the screen 
image changes, and even does a fair job of emulating a color xterm. It does not 
yet support graphics. x3270 is distributed as source code, and can be used for free.

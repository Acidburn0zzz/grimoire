CLEX is a file manager with a full-screen user interface written
in C with the curses library.

It displays directory contents (including file status details)
and provides features like command history, filename insertion,
or name completion in order to help the user to construct commands
to be executed by the shell (there are no built-in commands).

CLEX is easily configurable and all its features are explained
in the on-line help.

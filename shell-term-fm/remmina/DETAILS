Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming to be useful for 
system administrators and travellers, who need to work with lots of remote 
computers in front of either large monitors or tiny netbooks. Remmina supports 
multiple network protocols in an integrated and consistant user interface. 

Currently RDP, VNC, XDMCP and SSH are supported.

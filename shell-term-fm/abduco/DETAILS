abduco provides session management i.e. it allows programs to be run
independently from its controlling terminal. That is programs can be detached,
run in the background, and then later reattached. Together with dvtm it
provides a simpler and cleaner alternative to tmux or screen.

abduco is in many ways very similar to dtach but is actively maintained,
contains no legacy code, provides a few additional features, has a cleaner,
more robust implementation and is distributed under the ISC license.

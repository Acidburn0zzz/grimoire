cat << EOF
pypty is a tty logger aimed at heavy script(1) users who like to (or would
like to start to) log everything they do on important systems. It creates one
(or two, if you ask for timing data) file(s) per day. The distribution also
includes "script-replay", which is somewhat like the traditional
scriptreplay - that is, it's for replaying tty logs - but it does not require
timing data and lets you step forward and back in the log.

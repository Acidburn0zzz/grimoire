Apparix combines the properties of the cdargs utility and the CDPATH 
shell mechanism for fast navigation through the file system. It is 
especially useful for visiting and documenting both frequently and 
rarely used locations. Apparix enables you to attach marks to locations 
and jump to those locations by loading the mark. Marking, unmarking and 
jumping are simple operations that are performed in the current shell. 
By setting up convenient aliases for marking and jumping, the file system 
can be navigated in a fast and intuitive manner.

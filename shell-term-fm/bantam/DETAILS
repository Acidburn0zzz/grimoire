cat << EOF
Bantam is a fast, light file manager for X11. It is targeted at power
users who know their way around a file system and like to use the keyboard.
Its important features include single-keystroke commands as the primary mode
of operation, an arbitrary number of directory views, and a configurable
interface to external file viewers and editors.

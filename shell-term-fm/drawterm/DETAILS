drawterm(8) is a program that non-Plan 9 systems users can use to
establish graphical cpu(1) connections with Plan 9 CPU servers. Just as
a real Plan 9 terminal does, drawterm serves its local name space as
well as some devices (the keyboard, mouse, and screen) to a remote CPU
server, which mounts this name space on /mnt/term and starts a shell.
Typically, either explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell to
start rio(1).

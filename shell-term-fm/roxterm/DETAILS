ROXterm is intended to provide similar features to
gnome-terminal, based on the same VTE library, but with a
smaller footprint and quicker start-up time. It achieves this
by not using the Gnome libraries and by using a separate applet
to provide the configuration GUI. It can be used as a ROX
applet, as the name implies, or in any other X environment.

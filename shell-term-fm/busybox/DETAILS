BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common 
UNIX utilities into a single small executable.
It provides minimalist replacements for most 
of the utilities you usually find in GNU 
fileutils, shellutils, etc.  The utilities in 
BusyBox generally have fewer options than their
full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options 
that are included provide the expected 
functionality and behave very much like their 
GNU counterparts.  BusyBox provides a fairly 
complete POSIX environment for any small or 
embedded system.

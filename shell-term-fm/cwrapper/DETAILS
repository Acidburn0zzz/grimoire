cw is a non-intrusive real-time ANSI color wrapper for common unix-based
commands on GNU/linux.  cw is designed to simulate the environment of the
commands being executed, so that if a person types 'du', 'df', 'ping', etc.
in their shell it will automatically color the output in real-time according
to a definition file containing the color format desired.  cw has support for
wildcard match coloring, tokenized coloring, headers/footers, case scenario
coloring, command line dependent definition coloring, and includes over 50
pre-made definition files.

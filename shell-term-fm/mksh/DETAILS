mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh), a
Bourne-compatible shell which is largely similar to the original AT&T Korn
shell; mksh is the only pdksh derivate currently being actively developed. It
includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern,
robust shell good for interactive and especially script use. mksh has UTF-8
support (e.g. in the emacs editing mode); R46 corresponds to OpenBSD
5.1-current ksh (without GNU bash-like $PS1 and fancy character classes). The
code has throughoutly been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards
compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibility to other
modern shells - as well as a couple of its own) have been placed.

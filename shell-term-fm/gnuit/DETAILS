GNUIT (GNU Interactive Tools) provides an extensible file system browser,
an ASCII/hexadecimal file viewer, a process viewer/killer and other related
utilities and shell scripts. GNUIT can be used to increase the speed and
efficiency of copying and moving files and directories, invoking editors,
compressing and uncompressing files, creating and expanding archives,
compiling programs, sending mail and more.  GNUIT uses standard ANSI color
sequences, if they are available. GNUIT was formerly called GIT, but the name
has been changed to avoid confusion with the VCS.

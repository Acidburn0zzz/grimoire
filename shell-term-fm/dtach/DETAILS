cat << EOF
dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen, allowing
you to run a program in an environment that is protected from the controlling
terminal and attach to it later. dtach does not keep track of the contents
of the screen, and thus works best with programs that know how to redraw
themselves.

dtach does not, however, have the other features of screen, such as its
support of multiple terminals or its terminal emulation support. This makes
dtach extremely tiny compared to screen, making it more easily audited for
bugs and security holes, and also allows it to fit in environments where
space is limited, such as on rescue disks.

dtach has many possible uses, even though it is tiny. With dtach, you can:

    * Attach multiple times to the same program. Access to the dtach session
    is controlled through the Unix filesystem permissions; thus, you can
    trivially allow other people to watch your session.  * Run a program in
    an environment that is protected from the controlling terminal. This
    means that, for instance, the program running under dtach would not
    be affected by the terminal being disconnected for some reason.  *
    Run programs such as emacs, which tend to want full control over the
    terminal. dtach mostly acts as a relay, and does not mangle the text
    between the application and your terminal.  * Suspend dtach without
    suspending the running program. dtach can handle the suspend key itself
    instead of passing it to the running program, which may be useful for
    certain programs such as ircII.

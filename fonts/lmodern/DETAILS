The Latin Modern family of fonts consists of 72 text fonts and 20 mathematics
fonts, and is based on the Computer Modern fonts released into public domain
by AMS (copyright © 1997 AMS). The lm font set contains a lot of additional
characters, mainly accented ones, but not exclusively. There is one set of
fonts, available both in Adobe Type 1 format (*.pfb) and in OpenType format
(*.otf). There are five sets of TeX Font Metric files, corresponding to: Cork
encoding (cork-*.tfm); QX encoding (qx-*.tfm); TeX'n'ANSI aka LY1 encoding
(texnansi-*.tfm); T5 (Vietnamese) encoding (t5-*.tfm); and Text Companion
for EC fonts aka TS1 (ts1-*.tfm).

cat << EOF
The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
designed to replace the Xlib interface. It has several advantages over Xlib,
including size (small library and lower memory footprint), latency hiding
(batch several requests and wait for the replies later), direct protocol access
(one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol), thread support (access
XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking), and easy creation of
new extensions (automatically generates its interface from machine-parsable
XML protocol descriptions).  Xlib can also use XCB as a transport layer,
allowing software to make requests and receive responses with both, which
eases porting to XCB. However, client programs, libraries, and toolkits will
gain the most benefit from a native XCB port.

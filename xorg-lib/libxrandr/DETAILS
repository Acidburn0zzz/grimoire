cat << EOF
Xrandr is a simple library designed  to  interface  the  X  Resize  and
Rotate  Extension.  This allows clients to change the size and rotation
of the root window of a screen, along with the ability to  reflect  the
screen  about  either axis (if supported by the implementation).
Rotation and reflection may be implemented by software and  may
result  in slower performance if rotation and reflection are
implemented in this fashion(as are all implementations as of October 2002).

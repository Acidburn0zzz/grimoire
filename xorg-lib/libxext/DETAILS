XShm X Shared Memory extension functions
XShmQueryExtension  checks  to  see if the shared memory extensions are
available for the specified display.
XShape X nonrectangular shape functions
The X11 Nonrectangular Window Shape Extension adds nonrectangular
windows to the X Window System.
Xmbuf X  multibuffering  functions
The  application  programming  library  for  the  X11 Double-Buffering,
Multi-Buffering, and Stereo Extension contains the interfaces described
below.
Xevi - X Extended Visual Information functions
The X11 Extended Visual Information extension (EVI) allows a client  to
determine  information about core X visuals beyond what the core protocol
provides.
DBE - Double Buffer Extension
The  Double  Buffer  Extension (DBE) provides a standard way to utilize
double-buffering within the framework of the X Window System.   Double-
buffering  uses  two buffers, called front and back, which hold images.
The front buffer is visible to the user; the back buffer is not.   Suc-
cessive  frames of an animation are rendered into the back buffer while
the previously rendered frame is displayed in the front buffer.  When a
new  frame  is ready, the back and front buffers swap roles, making the
new frame visible.  Ideally, this exchange appears to happen  instanta-
neously  to  the user, with no visual artifacts.  Thus, only completely
rendered images are presented to the user, and  remain  visible  during
the  entire  time  it  takes  to  render  a new frame.  The result is a
flicker-free animation.

cat << EOF
Wayland is a protocol for a compositor to talk to its clients as well as a C library 
implementation of that protocol. The compositor can be a standalone display server running on 
Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an X application, or a wayland client itself. 
The clients can be traditional applications, X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other display 
servers.

Gentium is a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic groups
around the world who use the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality
publications. It supports a wide range of Latin-based alphabets and includes
glyphs that correspond to all the Latin ranges of Unicode.

The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and
visually attractive. The additional extended Latin letters are designed to
naturally harmonize with the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated
with careful thought and attention to their use. Gentium also supports
both ancient and modern Greek, including a number of alternate forms. These
fonts were originally the product of two years of research and study by the
designer at the University of Reading, England, as part of an MA program in
Typeface Design.

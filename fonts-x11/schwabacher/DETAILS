The Schwabacher is a blackletter typeface evolved from textualis under the
influence of Humanist type design in Italy. It was nearer to handwriting
than the textualis style. In the 16th century, it was displaced by fraktur as
the most-used German typeface from about 1530. Thereafter it was in use as a
secondary typeface in a similar way to italic. It was still used occasionally
until the mid 20th century.

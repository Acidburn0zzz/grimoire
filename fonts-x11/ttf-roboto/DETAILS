cat << EOF
The Android design language relies on traditional typographic tools such
as scale, space, rhythm, and alignment with an underlying grid. Successful
deployment of these tools is essential to help users quickly understand
a screen of information. To support such use of typography, Ice Cream
Sandwich introduced a new type family named Roboto, created specifically
for the requirements of UI and high-resolution screens. The current TextView
framework supports regular, bold, italic, and bold italic weights by default.

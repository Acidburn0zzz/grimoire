The latest MacOS release (10.6, or “Snow Leopard”) comes with a new
monospace font. It’s called “Menlo” and it’s a slightly modified
form of the standard Linux font (with appropriately weightly Linux name)
“DejaVu Sans Serif Mono”, which is itself an updated form of Bitstream
Vera Sans Mono. Apple’s modifications are a definite improvement to my
eyes, mostly because they thicken up some of the wispier glyphs from DejaVu,
like the underline and period.

The Mensch font is based on Menlo and is modified as follows:

 * Zero is back to being a circle with a dot in the middle.  * The
 ampersand’s loop was closed. That was also bugging me.  * Three is rendered
 in the gothic style, because the gothic style is clearly
   superior.
 * Lowercase L is drawn in a more traditional style (the Menlo variant looks
   bizarre to me), and one is turned gothic. I think the original artist
   drew the L weirdly to make it extremely clear that it’s not a one, but
   if you draw a gothic one, the difference is obvious even with a simpler L.
 * The bang, question, lowercase I, and lowercase J are made friendlier by
   turning the dots into actual circles, not just blocks.
 * Angle brackets are embiggened to facilitate languages like Java and C++ that
   use them to enclose class names. They parallel parens and square brackets
   in size now.
 * Q and lowercase Q are made more distinct. Lowercase Q gets a little more
   spunk. (This was a bit gratuitous.)

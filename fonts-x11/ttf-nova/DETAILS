I created the NovaCut font about 14-15 years ago for making inscriptions on
stone. Initially the font contained only capitals and digits and existed only on
paper and stone inscriptions. In 2010 I decided transfer this font to a
computer, and made the missing lowercase and some basical signs; it was
initially named Gothica. By the way I made other versions of some letters. It
was a lot of this at the end of my work. I decided create new fonts based on
these letters. And finally I created eight fonts family and named these fonts
Nova (NovaCut, NovaFlat, NovaOval, NovaRound, NovaSquare... - by the shape of
individual fonts). These are my first digital fonts, I made and they had some
defects. Now (29.05.2011) fonts are fixed.

ProFont is a monospaced font created to be a most readable font for programming.
Thus, it has slashed zeros; distinct forms of I, l and 1; and it is designed to
look good a really small sizes so you can cram lots of lines of code into the
window of your editor.

The original ProFont version was made for the classic Mac OS and contained
bitmapped shapes at 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18 and 24 points. Using this sizes with
anti-aliasing turned off, you get a clean and crisp programming font.

Anonymous Pro is a family of four fixed-width fonts designed especially with
coding in mind. Characters that could be mistaken for one another (O, 0, I,
l, 1, etc.) have distinct shapes to make them easier to tell apart in the
context of source code.

Anonymous Pro also features an international, Unicode-based character set,
with support for most Western and European Latin-based languages, Greek,
and Cyrillic. It also includes special “box drawing” characters for
those who need them.

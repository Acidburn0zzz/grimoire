Before casting atlas spell, you'd better turn off cpu throttling for
every cpu(core) according to the official installation documentation.

Tune your freq governor to "performance" somewhere like:
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu?/cpufreq/scaling_governor

During configuration, you'll be asked whether enabling wall timer.
According to official documentation, "if you are installing ATLAS on a
machine which is not heavily loaded, you will want to improve your
install by instructing ATLAS to use one of its higher resolution wall
timers.

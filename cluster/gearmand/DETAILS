cat << EOF
This is a rewrite (in C) of the Perl version found at http://danga.com/gearman/. It includes the 
both a client/worker library, as well as the server. The server acts as a bridge between workers 
(clients who can do work) and callers (clients who want work done). You should run several servers 
(at least two) for both load balancing and high availability.

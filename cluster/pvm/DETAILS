PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) is a software package that permits a heterogeneous
collection of Unix and/or NT computers hooked together by a network to be used as 
a single large parallel computer, a ``virtual machine''. Thus large computational 
problems can be solved more cost effectively by using the aggregate power and 
memory of many computers. Applications can be composed of any number of separate 
processes, or components, written in a mixture of C, C++ and Fortran.

LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous 
linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems 
of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. 
The associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, 
Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are related 
computations such as reordering of the Schur factorizations 
and estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded matrices 
are handled, but not general sparse matrices. In all areas, 
similar functionality is provided for real and complex matrices, 
in both single and double precision.

Contains also the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
library (Fortran version).

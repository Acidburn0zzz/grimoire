Farmerjoe is a distributed rendering system for Blender, it does both framex
 based distribution and bucket based (single frame) distribution, it has a web
gui and is fairly easy to set up IMHO :) I had tried to get Drqueue running and
it worked great on linux but was less than easy to use on windows. There are a
few other distributed rendering systems for blender but I wanted something I
could run independantly of blender and seeing how I knew perl I hacked together
this system to get distributed rendering running for Blender the way I wanted
it to work.

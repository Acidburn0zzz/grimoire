cat << EOF
This is a KControl Module which handles adding/editing/removing Telepathy
Accounts. It interacts with any Telepathy Spec compliant AccountManager,
such as telepathy-accountmanager-kwallet to manipulate the accounts. It is
modular in design, with each ConnectionManager-Protocol combination having a
plugin that provides customised forms for adding or editing their accounts,
and also with a generic plugin which can be used as a fallback for
ConnectionManager-Protocol combinations where no plugin exists.

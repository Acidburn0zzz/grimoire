GNOME Sudoku is meant to have as simple, unobstrusive an interface as possible
while still providing features that make playing difficult Sudoku more fun.
Some of the features are:

* The board and numbers automatically resize when you resize the window.
* The game is easily navigable from the keyboard -- you can use arrow keys to 
  move around and then just type the number to fill in the board.
* The game is easily playable with the mouse. Clicking on a square will 
  highlight it. Clicking on the square again will show you a grid with the 
  numbers 1 through 9; you can just click on a number to choose it.
* You can automatically fill in the current square (to quickly fill in the 
  last empty box in a row for example).
* You can click "hint" to show the numbers that are valid for the current 
  square.
* You can add notes or "pencilmarks" to squares easily - just click in the 
  square to select it, and then click in the upper or lower part of the 
  square to type the note. (You can also type "n" for note if you're a 
  keyboard-centric user).
* You can create "trackers" to automatically color certain entries a 
  different color. You can then easily delete all numbers of a certain color 
  (or delete all numbers that are not a certain color). This makes 
  trail-and-error a much easier technique to use (this is heresy to some, I 
  know, but can be quite helpful for difficult puzzles).

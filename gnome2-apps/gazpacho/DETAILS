Gazpacho is a fresh new GUI builder for the GTK+ toolkit designed to be
ultra easy to use.

It is strongly inspired by the Glade project but it is written from scratch
using the Python language. As a result there are few lines of code to read,
understand and to maintain!

One of the goals of the project is that the .glade files that Gazpacho
generates should be fully compatible with libglade so you can use Gazpacho
whatever the language your application is written with.

Gazpacho is released under the LGPL license so you can use and distribute
it freely. Gazpacho is very modular so integration with existing IDE
should be fairly easy to do.

Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, contact manager, and

Intelligent Junk Mail Control

Take control of your inbox! With Evolution's junk filtering,
you're free to read the email you want and not see much of
the email you don't. Bayesian-based junk filtering with
optional remote rules get rid of all of the emails which
bug you most.

Junk filtering is easy, too. You can either select "Mark as Junk"
under the edit or context menu — or simply click the junk button
on the toolbar.

Search Folders (formerly called vFolders)

See your email the way you want it. Search Folders are saved
intelligent searches which can display groups of email according
to user-specified criteria. Create Search Folders to combine
mail from different mail accounts into a single view, quickly
view all mail from your boss (or a particular friend :) — and new
in 2.0, optional include entire threads in the results!

Integrated Security

Evolution includes support for signing and encrypting mail via
GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) and S/MIME. Encrypting mail helps you protect
your privacy and helps those receiving your mail know its really
from you. Evolution 2.0 includes a handy interface to help you
manage your GPG keys and S/MIME certificates as well as a place to
manage keys and certificates which have been shared to you.

Desktop Integration

By using the evolution-data-server, other GNOME apps are
integrating with Evolution including:

    * gnome-panel calendar applet lists your appointments and tasks
    * Gaim patch to add buddies from evolution contacts
    * Planner - imports contacts and under development is
                a Planner backend that enables Evolution
                to show different planner files as lists of tasks

Filters

Filters enable you to organize your mail as it arrives or on request.
Filters allow you to bundle, sort and distribute mail into various
folders or otherwise process mail. You can create multiple filters
to perform multiple actins. For example, your filters could put
copies of one message into multiple folders, or keep one copy and
send one to another person, and it can do that quickly.

Searching

Evolution automatically indexes messages so searching for that
long lost email is faster and easier than many other mail clients.

Web Calendars

You can add your favorite Web calendar so you can see upcoming
football, movie or dvd releases, or a friend's schedule inside
of Evolution. One of the most popular sites for Web calendars
is icalshare.com.

Collaboration Server support

Evolution includes support for Exchange 2000/2003 and GroupWise.
You can configure Evolution to act as an Exchange client or a
GroupWise client. Also there are also several projects underway
to enable Evolution to support more collaboration servers
including OpenGroupware.org - let us know and we'll add your
project to this list!

Multiple Account Management

Account management tools let you receive, manage and organize
messages from multiple email accounts or collaboration servers.
Create new mail accounts easily with the Evolution account assistant.

BeeCrypt is a cryptography library that contains highly optimized C and assembler implementations of many well-known algorithms including Blowfish, MD5, SHA-1, Diffie-Hellman, and ElGamal. Unlike some other crypto libraries, BeeCrypt is not designed to solve one specific problem, like file encryption, but to be a general purpose toolkit which can be used in a variety of applications. There are also no patent or royalty issues associated with BeeCrypt.

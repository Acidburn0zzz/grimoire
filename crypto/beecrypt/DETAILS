BeeCrypt is a cryptography library that contains highly optimized C and
assembler implementations of many well-known algorithms including Blowfish,
MD5, SHA-1, Diffie-Hellman, and ElGamal.

Unlike some other crypto libraries, BeeCrypt is not designed to solve one
specific problem, like file encryption, but to be a general purpose toolkit
which can be used in a variety of applications.

Also, there are no known patent or royalty issues associated with BeeCrypt.

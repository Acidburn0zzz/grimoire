Engine_pkcs11 is an implementation of an engine for OpenSSL. It can be loaded using code, config file or 
command line and will pass any function call by openssl to a PKCS#11 module. Engine_pkcs11 is meant to be used 
with smart cards and software for using smart cards in PKCS#11 format, such as OpenSC. Originaly this engine 
was a part of OpenSC, until OpenSC was split into several small projects for improved flexibility.

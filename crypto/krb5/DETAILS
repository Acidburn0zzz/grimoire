cat << EOF
Kerberos was created by MIT as a solution to network security problems.
The Kerberos protocol uses strong cryptography so that a client can
prove its identity to a server (and vice versa) across an insecure
network connection. After a client and server has used Kerberos to
prove their identity, they can also encrypt all of their communications
to assure privacy and data integrity as they go about their business.

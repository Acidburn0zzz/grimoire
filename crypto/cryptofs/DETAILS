cat << EOF
CryptoFS will use a normal directory to store files encrypted. The mountpoint
will contain the decrypted files. Every file stored in this mountpoint will be
written encrypted (data and filename) to the directory that was mounted. If
you unmount the directory the encrypted data can only be access by mounting
the directory with the correct key again. Like other LUFS filesystems it does
not need root access or any complicated setup like creating a filesystem on
a encrypted disk using the loop device.

This package will create a shared library that can be used by LUFS's lufsd
to mount a directory containing encrypted data to another directory.

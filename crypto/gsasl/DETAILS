GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and Security
Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. SASL is used by network
servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication from clients, and in
clients to authenticate against servers. 

GNU SASL contains a library (libgsasl), a command line utility (gsasl) to
access the library from the shell, and a manual. The library includes
support for the SASL framework (with authentication functions and
application data privacy and integrity functions) and at least partial
support for the CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS, PLAIN, SECURID,
DIGEST-MD5, LOGIN, NTLM and KERBEROS_V5 mechanisms.

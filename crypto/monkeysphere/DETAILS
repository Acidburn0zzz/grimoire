cat << EOF
The Monkeysphere enables you to use the OpenPGP web of trust to verify
ssh connections. SSH key-based authentication is tried-and-true, but it
lacks a true public key infrastructure for key certification, revocation,
and expiration.  Monkeysphere is a framework that uses the OpenPGP web of
trust for these PKI functions. It can be used in both directions: for users
to get validated host keys, and for hosts to authenticate users.

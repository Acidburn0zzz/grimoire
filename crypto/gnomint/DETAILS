cat << EOF
gnoMint is a tool for easily creating and managing certification
authorities. It provides fancy visualization of all the pieces of information
that pertain to a CA, such as x509 certificates, CSRs, and CRLs. gnoMint is
currently capable of managing a CA that emits certificates that are able to
authenticate people or machines in VPNs (IPSec or other protocols), secure
HTTP communications with SSL/TLS, authenticate and cipher HTTP communications
through Web-client certificates, and sign or crypt email messages.

chntpw is a utility to (re)set the password of any user that has a valid (local)
account on your NT/2k/XP/Vista system by modifying the crypted password in the
registry's SAM file. You do not need to know the old password to set a new one.
Will detect and offer to unlock locked or disabled out user accounts!
It is also an almost fully functional registry editor!

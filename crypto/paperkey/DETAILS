A reasonable way to achieve a long term backup of OpenPGP (GnuPG, PGP,
etc) keys is to print them out on paper. Due to metadata and redundancy,
OpenPGP secret keys are significantly larger than just the "secret
bits". In fact, the secret key contains a complete copy of the public
key. Since the public key generally doesn't need to be backed up in this way
(most people have many copies of it on various keyservers, Web pages, etc),
only extracting the secret parts can be a real advantage.  Paperkey extracts
just those secret bytes and prints them. To reconstruct, you re-enter those
bytes (whether by hand or via OCR), and paperkey can use them to transform
your existing public key into a secret key.

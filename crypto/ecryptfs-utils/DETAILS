cat << EOF
eCryptfs is an POSIX-compliant enterprise-class
stacked cryptographic filesystem for Linux. It is
derived from Erez Zadok's Cryptfs, implemented
through the FiST framework for generating stacked
filesystems. It extends Cryptfs to provide
advanced key management and policy features. It
stores cryptographic metadata in the header of
each file written, so that encrypted files can be
copied between hosts; the file will be decryptable
with the proper key, and there is no need to keep
track of any additional information aside from
what is already in the encrypted file itself.
Think of it as a sort of &amp;quot;gnupgfs.''  It is a
native Linux filesystem, and can be built and
distributed as a stand-alone kernel module for
Linux 2.6.15 or higher.

gpgdir is a Perl script that uses the CPAN GnuPG module to encrypt and decrypt
directories using a GPG key specified in ~/.gpgdirrc. It supports recursively
descending through a directory in order to make sure it encrypts or decrypts
every file in a directory and all of its subdirectories. All file mtime and
atime values are preserved across encryption and decryption operations. In
addition, gpgdir is careful not to encrypt hidden files and directories.

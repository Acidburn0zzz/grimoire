Cryptcat is the standard netcat (v1.10) enhanced with twofish encryption.

Twofish is courtesy of counterpane, and cryptix. We started with the Java
version of twofish from cryptix, converted it to C++ (don't ask why), and
enhanced it by adding CBC mode and the ciphertext stealing technique from
Applied Cryptography (pg. 196).

How do you use it?

  Machine A: cryptcat -l -p 1234 < testfile
  Machine B: cryptcat <machine A IP> 1234

This is identical to the normal netcat options for doing exactly the same
thing. However, in this case the data transferred is encrypted.

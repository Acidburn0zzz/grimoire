Main features of this new implementation of a greylisting daemon are:

 * unique method of reverse client recognition suitable for ISPs
 * fast and safe
 * uses libdbi - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQLite3, Firebird/Interbase, mSQL
   supported
 * highly configurable â€” object oriented configuration
 * whitelisting by client network addresses, recipient and sender email address,
   client name, ...
 * pattern matching based whitelisting (regular expressions) for complex
   whitelisting needs
 * selectively pattern or table match senders/recipients/hosts/..
 * use as many databases and database types as you like
 * multithreaded tcp server (shared caches, high performance)
 * written in C++, STL

The unique and preferred greylisting method reverse is now the default. Instead
of using the IP address of the client it uses a significant part of the verified
client name (usually supplied by postfix) to find known triplets.

This mainly helps with ISPs using bigger mail relays in which case the client IP
address of a sender might vary. This is a unique feature not found in any other
greylisting daemons.

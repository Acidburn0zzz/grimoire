DSPAM is a scalable and open-source content-based spam filter designed for 
multi-user enterprise systems. On a properly configured system, many users 
experience results between 99.5% - 99.95%, or one error for every 200 to 2000 
messages. DSPAM supports many different MTAs and can also be deployed as a 
stand-alone SMTP appliance. For developers, the DSPAM core engine (libdspam) can
be easily incorporated directly into applications for drop-in filtering (GPL 
applies; commercial licenses are also available).

DSPAM has been implemented on many large and small scale systems with the largest
being reported at about 350,000 mailboxes. It is presently being used or planned
for use in multiple commercial solutions.

DSPAM is an adaptive filter which means it is capable of learning and adapting to
each user's email. Instead of working off of a list of "rules" to identify spam,
DSPAM's probabilistic engine examines the content of each message and learns what
type of content the user deems as spam (or nonspam). This approach to 
machine-learning provides much higher levels of accuracy than commercial
"hodge-podge" solutions, and with minimal resources. DSPAM's best recorded levels
of accuracy have included 99.991% by one avid user (2 errors in 22,786) and 99.987%
by the author (1 error in 7000), which is ten times more accurate than a human being!

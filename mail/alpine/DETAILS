           SHORT="A family of email tools built upon Pine"
cat << EOF
In late 2005, Computing & Communications at the University of Washington
began a project to create a new family of email tools built upon the Pine
Message System. This family of tools is called Alpine. Alpine consists of
a UNIX command-line program, a PC version, and a Web version.

Why Alpine? The Pine Team wanted to reorganize the very mature Pine source
code, distribute the Web version that has been very popular here at the
Univerity of Washington, and relax our trademark obligation for source
code quality control to a world-wide customer base.

The trademark obligation represents an ongoing administrative effort.
Coincidentally, the UW is standardizing its license for the several other
products we offer to the Apache License, Version 2.0.

The cleanest way to do all this was to stop developing Pine (a registered
trademark) and start a new product - thus Alpine was born.

OpenDKIM is an open source implementation of the DKIM (Domain Keys Identified
Mail) sender authentication system proposed by the E-mail Signing Technology
Group (ESTG), now standardized by the IETF (RFC6376).
It also includes implementations of the Author Domain Signing Practises (ADSP,
RFC5617) and Vouch By Reference (VBR, RFC5518) proposed standards, and the
experimental Authorized Third Party Signatures protocol (ATPS, RFC6541).

The OpenDKIM package consists of a library that implements the DKIM service and
a milter-based filter application that can plug in to any milter-aware MTA to
provide that service to sufficiently recent sendmail MTAs and other MTAs that
support the milter protocol.

An optional asynchronous resolver library is also provided to work around
limitations of the basic BIND resolver that comes installed on most systems.

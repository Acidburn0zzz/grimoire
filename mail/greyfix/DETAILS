Greyfix is the greylisting policy daemon for Postfix.

Features:
* Low and tunable resource usage and high efficiency. The program is written in
  C and uses Berkeley DB to track mailers. By itself it allocates memory only
  for a single request and the Berkeley DB library can be configured to use very
  few RAM.
* Integrates with Postfix's master daemon. Postfix will shutdown greyfix when it
  is not used completely freeing its runtime resources.
* No administrative burden. Everything happens "automagically".
* No need for a database server. Uses Berkeley DB which is already installed
  with most free Unix distributions.

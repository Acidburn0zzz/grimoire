cat << EOF
Purpose and value:
  This is sSMTP, a program that replaces sendmail on workstations that should
  send their mail via the departmental mailhub from which they pick up their
  mail (via pop, imap, rsmtp, pop_fetch, NFS... or the like).  This program
  accepts mail and sends it to the mailhub, optionally replacing the domain
  in the From: line with a different one.

  WARNING: the above is all it does. It does not receive mail, expand aliases
  or manage a queue.  That belongs on a mailhub with a system administrator.
  The man page (ssmtp.8) and the program logic manual (ssmtp_plm) discuss
  the limitations in more detail.

  It uses a minimum of external configuration information, and so can be
  installed by copying the (right!) binary and an optional four-line config
  file to a given machine.

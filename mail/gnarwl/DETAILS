cat << EOF
Gnarwl is a email autoreply/vacation agent, intented to be used on mailservers,
where users may not (nescessarily) have systemaccoounts, but accountinformation
is kept within an LDAP database.

Features:
- User information is kept in an LDAP database.
- Configurable via single systemwide configuration file.
- Careful about not creating mail loops by answering to mailing lists or other
  automated user agents.
- Configurable blacklist of corporate email addresses for which to never send
  out vacation notifications, even if an associated user is out of office.
- Works with all major mail transport agents (postfix, sendmail and qmail).
- Highly configurable output generation. Gnarwl allows the administrator to
  force headers and footers, users may reference fields of their own LDAP
  object in the outgoing mail.
- Unicode support.
- Status reports via syslog.

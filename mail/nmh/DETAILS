cat << EOF
nmh (new MH) is a powerful electronic mail handling system. It was originally
based on version 6.8.3 of the MH message system developed by the RAND
Corporation and the University of California. It is intended to be a (mostly)
compatible drop-in replacement for MH.

nmh consists of a collection of fairly simple single-purpose programs to
send, receive, save, retrieve, and manipulate e-mail messages. Since nmh is a
suite rather than a single monolithic program, you may freely intersperse nmh
commands with other commands at your shell prompt, or write custom scripts
which use these commands in flexible ways.

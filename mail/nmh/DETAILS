cat << EOF
nmh (new MH) is a powerful electronic mail handling system. It was originally based on version 6.8.3 
of the MH message system developed by the RAND Corporation and the University of California. It is 
intended to be a (mostly) compatible drop-in replacement for MH.

nmh consists of a collection of fairly simple single-purpose programs to send, receive, save, 
retrieve, and manipulate e-mail messages. Since nmh is a suite rather than a single monolithic 
program, you may freely intersperse nmh commands with other commands at your shell prompt, or write 
custom scripts which use these commands in flexible ways.

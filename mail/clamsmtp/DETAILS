cat << EOF
ClamSMTP is an SMTP filter that allows you to check for viruses using
the ClamAV anti-virus software. It accepts SMTP connections and forwards
the SMTP commands and responses to another SMTP server. The 'DATA' email
body is intercepted and scanned before forwarding. It is written with
the postfix mailserver in mind but can also be used as a transparent
proxy to filter all traffic.

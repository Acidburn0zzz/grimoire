Mb2md.pl was originally developed by Robin Whittle <rw at firstpr.com.au> (you
can find his old page here). It is a Perl script that takes one or more Mbox
format mailbox files in a directory and convert them to Maildir format
mailboxes. As the Mbox format has some drawbacks, D. J. Bernstein created the
Maildir format when he wrote Qmail. With the Mbox format all mail of a specific
folder is stored as one large text file. The Maildir format stores each mail as
a separate file. It is a faster and more efficient way to store mail. It works
particularly well over NFS, which has a long history of locking-related woes.
The Mbox format is used by most of the POP3/IMAP servers, most mail servers
(MTAs) and mail readers (MUAs). The Maildir format is used by Qmail,
Courier-MTA and can be also used as a alternative mail storage format by
Postfix and Exim. A good POP3/IMAP server for Maildirs is Courier IMAP.

Mb2md.pl does not only convert mailbox files into a Maildir but also the
/var/spool/mail/$USER mailspool file. It is smart enough to not transfer a
dummy message such as the UW IMAPD puts at the start of Mbox mailboxes - and
you could add your own search terms into the script to make it ignore other
forms of dummy first message.

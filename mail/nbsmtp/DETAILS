This tool is used when you don't want a big MTA on your box. Reasons are
maybe if you want to relay your mail over the one of your provider
or you have a powerful mail server in your company which manages the
queue. This means that nbsmtp does not manage your local mail queue, it
does only send it to a hub.

The above is all it does. To use nbsmtp you will also need an account on
a SMTP-server which allows you to relay over it.

Putmail is a very lightweight MTA or SMTP client, distributed under the
terms of
the X Consortium License. It is designed to replace the sendmail command when
used with MUAs that lack SMTP support, like mutt. Its main features are:

    * Command-line compatibility with sendmail.
    * TLS support. SSL can also be used with an external tool like stunnel.
    * IPv6 support. I have not tested this myself, but in theory it works. If
    you can confirm whether this works or not, please contact me.
    * Optional per-address configuration. You can use different settings
    depending on the From: header.
    * Multiplatform. It works on any platform Python works.
    * Simple to configure.
    * Short and sweet. Less than 500 lines of source code.

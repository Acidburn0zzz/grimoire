cat << EOF
OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the server-side SMTP protocol as defined
by RFC 5321, with some additional standard extensions. It allows ordinary
machines to exchange e-mails with other systems speaking the SMTP protocol.

Started out of dissatisfaction with other implementations, OpenSMTPD nowadays is
a fairly complete SMTP implementation.

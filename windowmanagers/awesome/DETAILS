cat << EOF
awesome is a floating and tiling window manager initialy based on a dwm code
rewriting. It's extremely fast, small, dynamic and awesome.

Windows can be managed in several layouts: tiled, maximized, dwindle, spiral,
floating. Each layout can be applied on the fly, optimizing the environment for
the application in use and the task performed.

Managing windows in tiled mode assures that no space will be wasted on your
screen. No gaps, no overlap. Other layouts can be used for different purpose.

If you do not want to use the tiling management, you can use the floating
layout wich will let you organize your windows as you wish, like any other
window manager.

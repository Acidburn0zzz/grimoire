cat << EOF
Scrotwm is a small dynamic tiling window manager for X11.
It tries to stay out of the way so that valuable screen real estate
can be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to
do any configuration. It was written by hackers for hackers and it
strives to be small, compact and fast.
It was largely inspired by xmonad and dwm.

A minimalist window manager for the X Window System.

'Minimalist' here doesn't mean it's too bare to be usable - it just means it omits a lot of the stuff that make other window managers unusable. Here is a list of features:

    * No window decorations apart from a simple 1 pixel border.
    * No icons.
    * Good keyboard control, including repositioning and maximise toggles.
    * Solid window drags (compile time option - may be slow on old machines).
    * Snap-to-border support (command line option).
    * Virtual desktops (compile time option).
    * Small binary size (even with everything turned on).

cat << EOF
dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled and floating layouts.
Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing the environment for the application
in use and the task performed. It is the little brother of wmii.
Dwm is only a single binary, it's source code is intended to never exceed 2000 SLOC.
Because dwm is customized through editing its source code, it's pointless to make binary
packages of it. This keeps its userbase small and elitist.
No novices asking stupid questions.

cat << EOF
dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled and
floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing
the environment for the application in use and the task performed.
It is the little brother of wmii. Dwm is only a single binary, it's
source code is intended to never exceed 2000 SLOC. Because dwm is
customized through editing its source code, it's pointless to make
binary packages of it. This keeps its userbase small and elitist.  No
novices asking stupid questions.

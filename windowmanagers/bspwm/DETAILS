bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of
a full binary tree.

It only responds to X events, and the messages it receives on a dedicated
socket.

bspc is a program that writes messages on bspwm's socket.

bspwm doesn't handle any keyboard or pointer inputs: a third party program
(e.g.  sxhkd) is needed in order to translate keyboard and pointer events
to bspc invocations.

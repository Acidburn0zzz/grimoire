PWM is a lightweight window manager

PWM is a rather lightweight window manager for X11. It has the unique
feature that multiple client windows can be attached to the same frame.
This feature helps keeping windows, especially numerous xterms,
organized.

Being a lightweight window manager with emphasis on usability, PWM does
not have all the features that one might expect from a window manager.
Those features are simply unnecessary. PWM does not provide pixmapped
themes or other bloated eye candies but has a clean and simple look
inspired by BeOS and Motif. There are no icons and frames cannot be
iconified, only "shaded." Only One True (pointer) focus mode is
supported: sloppy. PWM does not even have titlebar buttons and may not
be the easiest window manager to get into, most Good Things are not.

PWM does have workspaces, menus and WindowMaker dockapp support. It has
pretty good keyboard support and almost all the functionality is
configurable.

Openbox is a standards-compliant, fast, light-weight extensible windowmanager.
Openbox works with your applications and makes your desktop easier to manage.
This is because the approach to its development was the opposite to what seems
to be the general case for window managers.
Openbox was written first to comply with standards and to work properly. Only
when that was in place did the team turn to the visual interface.
Features:
* ICCCM and EWMH compliance
* Fast as f$%k
* Chainable key bindings
* Customizable mouse actions
* Window resistance
* Multi-head Xinerama support
* Pipe menus

The kdeaccessibility package contains three KDE Accessibility Aids: KMouseTool,
KMag and KMouth.

KMouseTool is a Linux-based KDE program. It clicks the mouse for you, so you
don't have to. KMouseTool works with any mouse or pointing device.

KMagnifier (or kmag, its unix name) is a small utility for Linux to magnify a
part of the screen. It magnifies the area of the screen around the mouse
pointer or optionally a user defined area. Additionally it offers to save a
magnified screenshot to disk.

KMouth is a KDE program which enables persons that cannot speak to let their
computer speak, e.g. mutal people or people who have lost their voice. It has a
text input field and speaks the sentences that you enter. It also has support
for user defined phrasebooks.

cat << EOF
Btpd is a utility for sharing files over the BitTorrent network protocol. It
runs in daemon mode, thus needing no controlling terminal or gui. Instead, the
daemon is controlled by the btcli command line utility, or other programs
capable of sending commands and queries on the btpd control socket.

The goal is to provide a healthy alternative to the still prevailing ftp/http
servers for file distribution sites and a good BitTorrent client for the casual
user.

Features of btpd include:

 * Reasonable resource usage.
 * Runs in daemon mode; no need for constant terminal or gui.
 * Command line interface.
 * Sharing of multiple torrents in one btpd process.
 * Upload and download rate limiting.
 * IPv6 support.
 * Multitracker support.

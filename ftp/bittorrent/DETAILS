BitTorrent is a protocol for distributing files. It identifies content 
by url and is designed to integrate seamlessly with the web. Its 
advantage over plain http is that when multiple downloads of the same 
file happen concurrently, the downloaders upload to each other, making it 
possible for the file source to support very large numbers of downloaders 
with only a modest increase in its load.

cat << EOF
The qBittorrent project was created in March 2006 with the idea of
developping a new Bittorrent client for Linux (and possibly other
systems) that would be easy to use, good looking, featureful but
lightweight.

qBittorrent is an attempt to provide a µtorrent equivalent on
Linux. It is a Free Software released under the GNU GPL
license. qBittorrent is based on Arvid Norberg's libtorrent-rasterbar.

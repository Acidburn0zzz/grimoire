opentracker is a open and free bittorrent tracker project. It aims for minimal
resource usage and is intended to run at your wlan router. Currently it is
deployed as an open and free tracker instance.
Utilizing the highly scalable server framework from libowfat, opentracker can

limited only by your kernels capabilities

cat << EOF
BitTornado is an improved bittorrent client that was built on the original
BitTorrent. This client features an enhanced console/curses mode, lots of new
features under the hood, and is generally one of the most advanced clients
out there. It allows you to limit your bandwidth consumption, and provides
more control over your torrents. It does everything the original bittorrent
does, plus more.

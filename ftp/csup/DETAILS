Csup is a rewrite of CVSup in the C language.  It was started for pragmatic
reasons rather than religious ones: the Modula-3 runtime environment has not
been ported to all the achitectures supported by the various *BSD projects,
plus it was increasingly difficult to find people for maintaining the code.

CVSup is a software for distributing and updating collections of files accross
a network.  It can efficiently and accurately mirror all types of files,
including sources, binaries, hard links, symbolic links, and even device nodes.
In addition to being a great general-purpose mirroring tool, CVSup includes
special features and optimizations specifically tailored to CVS repositories.

CVSup is being used as the preferred way to update sources within the FreeBSD,
NetBSD and OpenBSD projects, and by many more projects.

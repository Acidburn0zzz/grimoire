FSP stands for File Service Protocol. It is a very lightweight UDP based
protocol for transferring files. FSP has many benefits over FTP, mainly
for running anonymous archives. FSP protocol is valuable in all kinds of
environments because it is one of the only TCP/IP protocols that is not
aggressive about bandwidth, while still being sufficiently fault tolerant.

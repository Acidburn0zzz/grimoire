Nicotine is a feature complete client for the SoulSeek filesharing network. You
can use it to upload, download, search and chat. You can keep a "buddy" list
and basically everything else a SoulSeek client is supposed to do. If you are
familliar with PySoulSeek, you'll probably notice a striking resemblance in
appearance. More info: Daelstorm's Nicotine Propaganda page.

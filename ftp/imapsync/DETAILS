cat << EOF
imapsync is a tool for facilitating incremental recursive IMAP transfers from
one mailbox to another. It is useful for mailbox migration, and reduces the
amount of data transferred by only copying messages that are not present on
both servers. Read, unread, and deleted flags are preserved, and the process
can be stopped and resumed. The original messages can optionally be deleted
after a successful transfer.

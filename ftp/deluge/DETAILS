cat << EOF
Deluge is a BitTorrent client, created using Python and GTK+ (through PyGTK).
Deluge is currently usable on Linux, BSD, and other *NIX operating systems.
It is intended to bring a native, full-featured client to GTK desktop environments
such as GNOME and XFCE. The program uses the libtorrent C++ library. 
Up through the 0.4 branch, this was done through the python-libtorrent bindings for Python. 
In 0.5, the python-libtorrent bindings were merged into the main client as the deluge_core extension. 
In future releases, it is likely the official Python bindings for libtorrent will be used."

cat << EOF
Deluge is a BitTorrent client, created using Python and GTK+ (through PyGTK).
Deluge is currently usable on Linux, BSD, and other *NIX operating systems.
It is intended to bring a native, full-featured client to GTK desktop
environments such as GNOME and XFCE. The program uses the libtorrent C++
library.

Up through the 0.4 branch, this was done through the python-libtorrent bindings
for Python. In 0.5, the python-libtorrent bindings were merged into the main
client as the deluge_core extension. In future releases, it is likely the
official Python bindings for libtorrent will be used.

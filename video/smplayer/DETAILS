SMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for Mplayer/MPlayer2, from basic
features like playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features like
support for Mplayer filters and more. One of the main features is the ability
to remember the state of a played file, so when you play it later it will resume
at the same point and with the same settings. SMPlayer is developed with the Qt
toolkit, so it's multi-platform.

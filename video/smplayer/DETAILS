SMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for Mplayer, from basic features
like playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features like support for
Mplayer filters and more. One of the main features is the ability to remember
the state of a played file, so when you play it later it will resume at the
same point and with the same settings. SMPlayer is developed with the Qt
toolkit, so it's multi-platform.

Freevo is an open-source home theatre PC platform based on Linux and
a number of open-source audio/video tools. MPlayer and/or Xine can be
used to play audio and video files in most popular formats. Freevo can
be used both for a standalone PVR computer with a TV+remote, as well as
on a regular desktop computer using the monitor and keyboard.

Freevo is easy to download and install for new users. Most hardware is
supported (graphic boards, sound cards and video capture devices).

The Freevo core is under heavy development. It is mostly written in the
Python programming language which is very well suited for high-level
control applications like Freevo.

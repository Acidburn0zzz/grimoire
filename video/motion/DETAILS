Motion is a software motion detector. It grabs images from video4linux devices and/or from webcams (such as the axis network cameras). Motion is the perfect tool for keeping an eye on your property keeping only those images that are interesting.

Some of motion's options include:

    * Taking snapshots of movement
    * Watch multiple video devices at the same time
    * Watch multiple inputs on one capture card at the same time
    * Live streaming webcam (using multipart/x-mixed-replace)
    * Realtime creation of mpeg movies using libavcodec from ffmpeg
    * Create mpeg movies from snapshots after events using mpeg_encode
    * Take automated snapshots on regular intervals
    * Take automated snapshots at iregular intervals using cron
    * Sending an email when detecting movement
    * Sending a SMS message when detecting movement
    * Execute external commands when detecting movement
    * Motion tracking
    * Feed events to an MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
    * Feed video back to a video4linux loopback for realtime viewing
    * Web interface using motion.cgi

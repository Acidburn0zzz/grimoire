MythDVD is a MythTV module (see http://www.mythtv.org) that allows you to
play DVDs and (optionally) VCDs. It can also be configured to let you rip
DVDs and transcode their video and audio content to other (generally
smaller) formats. The playing features are simply myth-style wrappers for
your favorite DVD/XVCD playing software (mplayer, ogle, xine, etc). The
transcoding is based on and derived from the excellent transcode package.

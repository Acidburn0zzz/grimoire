GShow TV is a TV program schedule viewer and a Personal Video Recorder
GUI. GShow TV's basic purpose is to provide a nice GUI for viewing tv program
schedule information and for recording the programs. GShow TV doesn't itself do
the recording of the selected programs, rather it uses any PVR solution that
exists. GShow TV is globally usable as it uses XMLTV to access the program
schedules, and xmltv has support for multitude of countries. (early 2006
support for Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Reunion
Island, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
The Netherlands, The UK, The USA and more.)

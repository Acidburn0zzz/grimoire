ucview is a video image capture application that uses the unicap toolkit. It 
provides a simple way to parametrize the video device, can capture still images 
from the video stream, or record the stream as an MPEG file. By using unicap, 
it can access many different video capture devices like webcams, video grabber 
boards, IEEE-1394 (FireWire) cameras, and others.

cat << EOF
Transmageddon is a video transcoder for Linux and Unix systems built using
GStreamer. It supports almost any format as its input and can generate a very
large host of output files. The goal of the application was to help people
to create the files they need to be able to play on their mobile devices and
for people not hugely experienced with multimedia to generate a multimedia
file without having to resort to command line tools with ungainly syntaxes.

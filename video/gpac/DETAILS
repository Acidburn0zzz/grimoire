GPAC features encoders and multiplexers, publishing and content
distribution tools for MP4 and 3GPP(2) files and many tools for scene
descriptions (BIFS/VRML/X3D converters, SWF/BIFS, SVG/BIFS, etc...).
MP4Box provides all these tools in a single command-line application. An

* File layout: fragmentation or interleaving, and cleaning,
* File hinting for RTP/RTSP and QTSS/DSS servers (MPEG-4 / ISMA /
* 3GP / 3GP2 files),
* File splitting by size or time, extraction from file and file
* concatenation,
* XML information dumping for MP4 and RTP hint tracks,
* Media Track extractions,
* ISMA E&A encryption and decryption,
* 3GPP timed text tools (SUB/SRT/TTXT/TeXML), VobSub import/export,
* BIFS codec and scene conversion between MP4, BT and XMT-A,

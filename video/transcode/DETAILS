Transcode is a text console video-stream processing tool. It supports
elementary video and audio frame transformations. Some example modules are
included to enable import of MPEG-1/2, Digital Video, and other formats. It
also includes export modules for writing to AVI files with DivX, OpenDivX,
XviD, Digital Video or other codecs. Direct DVD transcoding is also supported.
A set of tools is available to extract and decode the sources into raw
video/audio streams for import and to enable post-processing of AVI files.

dvbcut is a Qt application that allows you to select certain parts of an MPEG
transport stream (as received via Digital Video Broadcasting, DVB) and save
these parts into a single MPEG output file. It follows a "keyhole surgery"
approach where the input video and audio data is mostly kept unchanged,
and only very few frames at the beginning and/or end of the selected range
are re-encoded in order to obtain a valid MPEG file.

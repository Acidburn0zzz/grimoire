MythWeb is a set of php files intended (note the use future tense)
to let you access your listings, flag shows for recording, delete
recordings, etc., from a web browser. At some point in the future, it may
allow you to play your recorded content (music and/or(?) video) across a
network. Then again, it may not.

Note that MythWeb is totally insecure and makes no pretense of
including any security mechanisms of any sort. You should really only run it
on an isolated network or (at the very least) behind a well secured firewall.

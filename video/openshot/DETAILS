OpenShot Video Editor is a program designed to create and edit videos on Linux.
It can easily combine multiple video clips, audio clips, and images into
a single project, and then export the video into many common video formats.

OpenShot is a non-linear video editor, which means any frame of video can be
accessed at any time, and thus the video clips can be layered, mixed, and
arranged in very creative ways.  All video clip edits (trimming, cutting,
etc...) are non-destructive, meaning that the original video clips are never
modified.

You can use OpenShot to create photo slide shows, edit home videos, create
television commercials and on-line films, or anything else you can dream up.

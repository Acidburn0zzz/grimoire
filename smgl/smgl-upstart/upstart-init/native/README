Some useful things to know about upstart on smgl

- The jobs upstart knows about are in the *.conf files, one file per service/daemon/task/job
- The jobs MAY NOT FAIL, or the entire boot process is halted...
- use a script in the scripts dir and a job  pointing to it when a job can fail and make sure the script exits cleanly
- daemons shouldn't disassociate themselves from the invoking tty if upstart it to track them

feel free to post bugs with additional jobs on http://bugs.sourcemage.org and assign them to abouter@sourcemage.org
I'll get to them eventually, or just put them in the spell yourself if you have git access ;)

starting and stopping jobs in upstart:

  start <jobname>

or

  stop <jobname>

where <jobname> is the jobs name in /etc/init without the .conf part.

for example, to start lighty:

  start lighttpd

a list of jobs and there status:

  initctl list

Some useful things to know about upstart on smgl

- The jobs upstart knows about are in the *.conf files, one file per service/daemon/task/job, add or remove the .conf
  part to en-/disable the job
- The jobs MAY NOT FAIL, or the entire boot process is halted...
- use a script in the scripts dir and a job  pointing to it when a job can fail and make sure the script exits cleanly
- if a job needs to emit a signal, name it <jobname>-start or <jobname>-stop for consistency

feel free to post bugs with additional jobs on http://bugs.sourcemage.org and assign them to abouter@sourcemage.org
I'll get to them eventually, or just put them in the spell yourself if you have git access ;)

starting and stopping jobs in upstart:

  start <jobname>

or

  stop <jobname>

where <jobname> is the jobs name in /etc/init without the .conf part.

for example, to start lighty:

  start lighttpd

a list of jobs and there status:

  initctl list

cat << EOF
This is the initial setup manpage for Source Mage GNU/Linux. It will walk you
through the steps needed to finish setting up and customizing a Source Mage
system. This is particularly useful after a fresh install of SMGL, but is also
handy when you want to change a setting but don't remember where it would be.
Experienced SMGL users probably don't need to read this man page.

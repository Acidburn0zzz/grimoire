cat << EOF
The Epoch Init System is a small but powerful init system for Linux 2.6+.
It requires a libc, (not glibc specific), a Linux kernel of 2.6 or greater,
a shell is recommended, and while it will function somewhat without it, /proc.
It has very low memory usage, very small binary size, and is designed to be
suitable for both full blown desktop and server systems as well as keeping
minimalist and embedded distros heavily in mind. It is architecture and
compiler independent, written in mostly ANSI C, and is designed with a
philosophy in mind:

1. Features that aren't our business aren't our business.
2. Service tracking and management is the business of the init system
3. Be unintrusive and easily replaced without a reinstall of the OS.
4. Don't require any dependency libraries outside of libc.
5. Be small and efficient, but not so small as to be a poor choice for desktops
and servers.
6. Be easily configured and tidy with our configuration.
7. If it's easy as well as non-costly to implement, and people wish they could
do that, let them do that.

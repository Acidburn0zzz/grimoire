The initramfs listing files have been put into /usr/share/linux-initramfs
you should take a look at them and make changes if you like. You may need
to remove modules that you have builtin or add modules you want to load
before the root filesystem is mounted.

Also checkout the /etc/linux-initramfs/* and /sbin/mkinitrd for generating
separate initramfs files for use in suspend/resume, raid or lvm.

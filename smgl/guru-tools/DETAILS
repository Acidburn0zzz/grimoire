There are various useful tools that have been written by Source Mage developers
over the years. Here we have bundled them together for your Guru experience:

checkGrimoire.sh        - checks the grimoire (or sections of it) for
                          broken links.
                          (by Paul)

dependsSquish.sh        -  takes a list of spells and outputs the order in
                           which to cast them so dependancies are taken care of.

findLibDepends.sh       - find missing dependancies of spells with ldd.(by
Paul)

findSharedFiles         - tool for finding files shared between spells.
                          (by Rasmus Ory Nielsen)

gazeSpider [<item ...]  - validates urls for entire grimoire or if item
                          give, for one or more items. Items may be either 
                          spells or sections.

grimoireCircCheck.sh    - check grimoires for circular dependancies and
                          incidentaly, missing spells. (by Paul)

historyfix.pl           - outputs an sh script for editing and patching all
                          the history
                          problems in a grimoire, section, spell. When you've
                          tried it once and checked its output, just pipe it
                          into sh and then p4 submit.  historyfix.pl with no
                          arguments does the current directory recursively.
                          historyfix.pl with arguments does only the files
                          supplied in the args. (by Seth Woolley)

image.sh <grimoire-path> - print a grimoire image. This script is used to
                          create images for the report.pl tool listed below.
                          Try piping output as follows: '| tee <file.image>'
                          and then pass the files to report.pl below. (by
                          Andrew Stitt)

md5unpack <tarball>     - provides md5sum info from source tarball.

rebuildPackages         - In case you delete your /var/state/sorcery/packages
                          file ;)

report.pl <image1> <image2> - this tool take two different images created by
                          the image.sh tool and report the differences,
                          amazing amount of information! (see image.sh above)

                          by one, by hand. Summonsection kills cached files,
                          and summons new files automaticaly. (by M.L.).

urlwatch                - checks a list of urls for changes inside html page.
                          Make a cronjob with this and you'll automaticaly
                          receive notifications for changed urls by email...
                          See urlwatch --help for help. (by M.L.).

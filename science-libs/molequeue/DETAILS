MoleQueue is a part of the Open Chemistry project, developed initially to integrate 
with computational chemistry codes on the desktop and on high-performance computing 
(HPC) resources. It has been developed as a standalone, system-tray resident 
application that runs a graphical application and a local server (using local sockets 
for communication) that is powered by Qt. It supports the configuration of multiple 
queues (local and remote), each containing one-or-more programs to be executed. 
Applications communicate with MoleQueue using JSON-RPC 2.0 over a local socket, and 
receive updates as the job state changes

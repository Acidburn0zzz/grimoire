Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit (MRPT).
The MRPT project comprises of libraries and tools aimed to help researchers
in the areas of mobile robots and computer vision in the development of
efficient implementations with reusability of code as a priority.
It includes classes for easily managing 3D(6D) geometry, probability density
functions (pdfs) over many predefined variables (points,landmarks,poses,maps,...),
Bayesian inference (Kalman filters, particle filters), image processing, obstacle
avoidance, etc...

NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface for array-oriented data 
access and a library that provides an implementation of the interface. 
The netCDF library also defines a machine-independent format for representing 
scientific data. Together, the interface, library, and format support the 
creation, access, and sharing of scientific data. The netCDF software was 
developed at the Unidata Program Center in Boulder, Colorado.

Note: This spell for NetCDF 4.x misses the new NetCDF-4 file format since
we do not have the HDF5 libs packaged.

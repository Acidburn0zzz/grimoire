cat << EOF
FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches
in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of algorithms we found to
work best for nearest neighbor search and a system for automatically choosing
the best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the dataset.
FLANN is written in C++ and contains bindings for the following languages: C,
MATLAB and Python.

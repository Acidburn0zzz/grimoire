The HAM radio equipment control libraries, Hamlib for short, allow you to
write amateur radio equipment control programs for transceivers which use CAT
or similar computer interfaces for control.

Hamlib is a development effort to provide a consistent interface for
programmers wanting to incorporate radio control in their programs.  Hamlib is
not a complete user application, rather, it is a software layer intended to
make controlling various radios and other shack hardware much easier.  Hamlib
will allow authors of such software as logging programs, digital
communications programs, or those wanting to develop the ultimate radio
control software to concentrate on the user interface and the basic function
of the program rather than radio control.

Quod Libet is a GTK+-based audio player written in Python.
It's designed around the idea that you know better than we do how to organize
your music. It lets you make playlists based on regular expressions (don't
worry, regular searches work too). It lets you display and edit any tags you
want in the file. And it lets you do this for all the file formats it supports
-- Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Musepack, and MOD.

Quod Libet easily scales to libraries of thousands of songs.
It also supports most of the features you expect from a modern media player,
like Unicode support, multimedia keys, and tag editing.

Ex Falso is a program that uses the same tag editing backend as Quod Libet,
but isn't connected to an audio player. If you're perfectly happy with your
favorite player and just want something that can handle tagging, Ex Falso
is for you.

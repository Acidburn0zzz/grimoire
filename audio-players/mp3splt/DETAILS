Mp3Splt is a command line utility to split mp3 (VBR supported) and ogg files
selecting a begin and an end time position, without decoding. It's very useful
to split large mp3/ogg to make smaller files or to split entire albums to obtain
original tracks. If you want to split an album, you can select split points and
filenames manually or you can get them automatically from CDDB (internet or a
local file) or from .cue files. Supports also automatic silence split, that can
be used also to adjust cddb/cue splitpoints.
Otherwise if you have a file created either with Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap you can
extract tracks just in few seconds.

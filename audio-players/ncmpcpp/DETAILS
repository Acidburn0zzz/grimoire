cat << EOF
ncmpcpp is very similar to ncmpc if it comes to user interface, but it provides
a lot of additional features:

* tag editor
* playlist editor
* easy to use search engine
* media library
* music visualizer
* ability to fetch artist info from last.fm
* new display mode
* alternative user interface
* ability to browse and add files from outside of MPD music directory

...and a lot more minor functions.

Shell-fm is a lightweight, console-based player for Last.FM radio streams. It's
pretty small (the binary is currently a little smaller than 60K, or 50K when
stripped) and it has most features the "official" player has, if not even a few
more. Additional features are, for example:

    * network interface (control shell-fm remotely)
    * autoban (automatically ban all tracks of an artist you don't like)
    * bookmark stations (quickly jump to bookmarked stations with a single key)
    * ... probably more

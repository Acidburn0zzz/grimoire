Muine is a music player using some new UI ideas. The idea is that it will be
much easier and comfortable to use than the iTunes model, which is used by
both Rhythmbox and Jamboree. It is written in C and C#, using GStreamer for
music playback.  
Features: 
* A simple, intuitive user interface 
* Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC and MP3 music playback support 
* Automatic album-cover fetching via MUsicBrainz and Amazon 
* Support for embedded album images ind ID3v2 tags 
* ReplayGain support 
* Support for multiple artist and performer tags per song 
* Plug-in support 
* Translations into many languages

From http://www.alsaplayer.org/
AlsaPlayer is a new type of PCM player. 
It is heavily multi-threaded and tries to excercise the 
ALSA library and driver quite a bit. It has some very 
interesting features unique to Linux/Unix players. The 
goal is to create a fully pluggable framework for 
playback of all sorts of media with the focus on PCM 
audio data. The core code was written by Andy Lo-A-Foe 
<andy at alsaplayer dot org> (or <arloafoe at cs dot vu dot nl>) 
with contributions from many other folks. 
See the credits files for details.

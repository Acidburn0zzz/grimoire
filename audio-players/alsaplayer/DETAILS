AlsaPlayer is a new type of PCM player. It is heavily multi-threaded and
tries to excercise the ALSA library and driver quite a bit. It has some
very interesting features unique to Linux/Unix players. The goal is to
create a fully pluggable framework for playback of all sorts of media with
the focus on PCM audio data.

DerMixD takes an arbitrary number of input channels and creates an arbitrary
number of mixes on an arbitrary number of output channels (i.e. audio device
on host machine).
It is controlled via simple commands on TCP socket (you can talk to it with
telnet) that are scriptable in a timed manner.
Most important input class is MPEG audio files/streams via (recent)
mpg123 (there is a sine generator for fun and raw audio input) and on the
output side there's OSS and ALSA as well as raw and text (tab-separated value).

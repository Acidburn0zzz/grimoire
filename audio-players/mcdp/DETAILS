cat << EOF

From original README:

- mcdp is a small (maybe the smallest) cd-player for linux
- it compiles/runs out off the box
- it can be compiled against dietlibc (~16kb static!)
- working play methods: repeat cd, repeat track and intro
- since version 0.3a, minimal cddb title download is also included

I must add that it's a ncurses based cd-player which works
pretty nice under console (linux virtual console), not requiring
graphical environment (like X) at all.

The low side, is that I haven't figured out yet how to make
CDDB_SERVER support work.  I haven't gotten an answer from
upstream, however that doesn't demerit the cd-player.  Pretty
small, low resource demanding, and pretty easy to use, :).

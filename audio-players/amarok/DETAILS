There are many media players around these days, true. What's missing from
most players is a user interface, that doesn't get in the way of the user. 

How many buttons do you have to press for simply adding some new tracks to
the playlist? 

amaroK tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and drop
interface, that really makes playlist handling easy.

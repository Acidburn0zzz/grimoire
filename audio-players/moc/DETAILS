cat << EOF
MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX designed 
to be powerful and easy to use.  You just need to select a file from 
some directory using the menu similar to Midnight Commander, and 
MOC will start playing all files in this directory beginning from 
the chosen file. There is no need to create play lists like in other players.
If you want to combine some files from one or few directories on one 
play list, you can do this. The play list will be remembered between 
runs or you can save it as an m3u file to load it whenever you want.

MOC plays smoothly, regardless of system or I/O load because it uses
the output buffer in a separate thread.

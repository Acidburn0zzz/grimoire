cat << EOF
It features a client-server model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user
interfaces, both textual and graphical. All common audio formats are supported
using plugins. On top of this, there is a flexible media library to organize
your music.

List of features currently offered by XMMS2:

Client-server model 

* Allows XMMS2 to have various multiple interfaces (as clients).
   o Command line interfaces
   o GTK clients (matching GNOME & XFCE4 look and feel)
   o KDE clients (matching KDE look and feel)
* Network transparency means you can run and control XMMS2 remotely, (e.g. run
XMMS2 on your 'media box' and control it over network using a bluetooth-enabled
PDA (TCP))

Wide format support 

Can play FLAC, mp3, MOD, SID, speex, ogg vorbis, wave files.

Clean separation of transport and decoder subsystems 

Allows for more flexible access to media. (e.g. play mp3 files from a Samba
share without having to mount it on the local filesystem)

Medialib 

Database-driven media library stores metadata about songs as they're played,
so songs can be quickly recalled and new playlists easily made.

Visualisation support

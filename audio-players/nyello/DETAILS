Nyello is a command-line XMMS2 client.

 It aims at providing a high-level interface to the XMMS2 server, with a
 concise and powerful interaction syntax. It boasts (or soon will boast)
 advanced features, such as rich pattern expressions to efficiently browse
 your library, smart completion of commands and custom song collections to
 organize your library.

 It can either run a single command or work like a shell (if started
 without argument). As a command-line program, it is mostly targetted at
 Unix power-users.

 nyello is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL, version 2.0 or later.

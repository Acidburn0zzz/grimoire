 streamtuner is a stream directory browser. Through the use of a plugin 
system, it offers an intuitive GTK+ 2.0 interface to Internet radio 
directories such as SHOUTcast and Live365.
With streamtuner, you can:
    * Browse the SHOUTcast Yellow Pages
    * Browse the Live365 directory
    * Browse the Xiph.org (aka icecast.org, aka Oddsock) directory
    * Browse the basic.ch DJ mixes
    * Manage your local music collection, with full support for ID3 and 
Vorbis metadata editing
    * Listen to streams, browse their web page, or record them using 
programs such as Streamripper
    * Implement new directory handlers as tiny Python scripts or as 
dynamically loadable modules written in C
    * Retain your favourite streams by bookmarking them
    * Manually add streams to your collection

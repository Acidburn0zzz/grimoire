cat << EOF
dfu-util is a program that implements the Host (PC) side of the USB DFU
(Universal Serial Bus Device Firmware Upgrade) protocol.

In the Openmoko project, we use this program to communicate with our specially
enhanced bootloader, which implements the DFU device side.

Using dfu-util and your smartphone, you can - transfer and flash partitions
in internal NAND Flash.  - transfer anything into RAM
  this can be used for fast development cycles of low-level code such as
  kernels without flashing them
- read out the current internal NAND partitions
  this is an easy and efficient way of doing full backups of your phone

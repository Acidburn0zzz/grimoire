Duc is a collection of tools for indexing, inspecting and visualizing disk
usage. Duc maintains a database of accumulated sizes of directories of
the file system, and allows you to query this database with some tools,
or create fancy graphs showing you where your bytes are.

Duc is built to scale to huge filesystems: it will index and display hundreds
of millions of files on petabytes of storage without problems.

Duc stores the disk usage in a optimized database, resulting in a fast user
interface. No wait times once the index is complete.

Duc comes with a number of user interfaces for quering the database: use
Duc on the console with a command line or ncurses interface, on graphical
desktops with an X or OpenGL GUI, or over the web using the CGI interface.

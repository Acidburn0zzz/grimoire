cat << EOF
This is a fork of the nss_ldap package by PADL Software Pty Ltd.. This fork was
done to implement some structural design changes. These changes were needed
because there are some issues with the original design. See the documentation
section for more details.

These problems are solved by splitting the library in two parts: a daemon that
connects to the LDAP server and does all the requests and a thin NSS connector
that passes requests to the daemon through a socket.

The nss-ldapd implementation has a number of advantages:

 * lighter NSS library
 * simpler internal semantics
 * clear separation between NSS and LDAP code (the server part could easily be
   implemented in another language)
 * less connections to the LDAP server

The fork is also a major code overhaul having a number of simplifications and
removal of old compatibility code. Compatibility will be re-added with later
releases of nss-ldapd for those platforms that need it.

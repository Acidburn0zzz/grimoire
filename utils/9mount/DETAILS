cat << EOF
9mount is a set of SUID mounting tools for use with v9fs to help cope with linux's poor mount support (I have to be root? Hostnames are only resolved for nfs?). It also gives dial string support and defaults to 9p2000.

The tools offer a level of security - 9mount will only let you mount over non-sticky directories you have write access to (no mounting over /tmp), and 9umount won't let you unmount partitions mounted by someone else, unless the mount point happens to be in your home directory.

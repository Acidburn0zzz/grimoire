cat << EOF
nut is nutrition software to record what you eat and analyze your meals
for nutrient composition. The database included is the USDA Nutrient
Database for Standard Reference, Release 18, which contains 7,146 foods
and 136 nutrients. This database contains values for vitamins, minerals,
fats, calories, protein, carbohydrates, fiber, etc., and includes the
essential polyunsaturated fats, Omega-3 and Omega-6. Nutrient levels are
expressed as a percentage of the Daily Value, the familiar standard of food
labeling in the United States, but also can be fully customized. Foods can
be added from recipes or food labels, and nutrient intake can be graphed.
The program is completely menu-driven and there are no commands to learn.

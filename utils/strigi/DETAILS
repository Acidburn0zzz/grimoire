Strigi is a desktop search engine.

Here are the main features of Strigi:
very fast crawling
very small memory footprint
no hammering of the system
pluggable backend, currently clucene and
hyperestraier, sqlite3 and xapian are in the works
communication between daemon and search program
over an abstract interface with two
implementations: DBus and a simple unix socket.
Especially the DBus interface makes it very easy
to write client applications.

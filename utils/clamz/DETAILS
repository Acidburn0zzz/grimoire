Clamz is a little command-line program to download MP3 files from Amazon.com's
music store. It is intended to serve as a substitute for Amazon's official
MP3 Downloader, which is not free software (and therefore is only available
in binary form for a limited set of platforms.)  Clamz can be used to download
either individual songs or complete albums that you have purchased from Amazon.

Plan 9 is a distributed computing environment built at Bell Labs
starting in the late 1980s. The system can be obtained from Bell Labs at
http://plan9.bellâˆ’labs.com/plan9 and runs on PCs and a variety of other
platforms. Plan 9 became a convenient platform for experimenting with
new ideas, applications, and services.
Plan 9 from User Space provides many of the ideas, applications, and
services from Plan 9 on Unix-like systems. It runs on FreeBSD (x86),
Linux (x86 and PowerPC), Mac OS X (PowerPC), OpenBSD (x86), and SunOS
(Sparc).

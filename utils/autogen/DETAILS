AutoGen is a tool designed to simplify the creation and maintenance of
programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text. It is
especially valuable in programs that have several blocks of text that
must be kept synchronized.

AutoGen can now accept XML files as definition input, in addition to
CGI data and traditional AutoGen definitions.

A common example where this would be useful is in creating and
maintaining the code required for processing program options.
Processing options requires multiple constructs to be maintained in
parallel in different places in your program. Options maintenance
needs to be done countless times. So, AutoGen comes with an add-on
package named AutoOpts that simplifies the maintenance and
documentation of program options.

The Bluetooth wireless technology is a worldwide specification for a small-form
factor, low-cost radio solution that provides links between mobile computers,
mobile phones, other portable handheld devices, and connectivity to the
Internet. The specification is developed, published and promoted by the
Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG).

BlueZ provides support for the core Bluetooth layers and protocols. It is
flexible, efficient and uses a modular implementation. It has many interesting
features:

  * Complete modular implementation
  * Symmetric multi processing safe
  * Multithreaded data processing
  * Support for multiple Bluetooth devices
  * Real hardware abstraction
  * Standard socket interface to all layers
  * Device and service level security support

Currently BlueZ consists of many separate modules:

  * Bluetooth kernel subsystem core
  * L2CAP and SCO audio kernel layers
  * RFCOMM, BNEP, CMTP and HIDP kernel implementations
  * HCI UART, USB, PCMCIA and virtual device drivers
  * General Bluetooth and SDP libraries and daemons
  * Configuration and testing utilities
  * Protocol decoding and analysis tools

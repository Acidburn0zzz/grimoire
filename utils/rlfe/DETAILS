rlfe (ReadLine Front-End) is a "universal wrapper" around readline.

You specify an interactive program to run (typically a shell), and readline is
used to edit input lines.

There are other such front-ends; what distinguishes this one is that it monitors
the state of the inferior pty, and if the inferior program switches its terminal
to raw mode, then rlfe passes your characters through directly. This basically
means you can run your entire session (including bash and terminal-mode emacs)
under rlfe.

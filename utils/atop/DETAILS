Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor similar to the command 
top. For every interval (default 10 seconds), it shows system-level 
activity related to the CPU, memory, swap, disks and network layers, and 
it shows for every active process the CPU utilization in system and user 
mode, the virtual and resident memory growth, priority, username, state, 
and exit code. The process level activity is also shown for processes 
which finished during the last interval (for this reason process 
accounting is switched on), to get a complete overview about the 
consumers of things such as CPU time. Atop only shows the active 
system-resources and processes, and only shows the deviations since the 
previous interval (e.g., the memory growth rather than total memory usage 
per process).

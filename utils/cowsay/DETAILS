Cowsay is the easy way to add speaking and thinking cows (and a few other
creatures) to anything. Any message you like, even in large figlet letters,
can be rattled off by these ASCII critters. Cowsay comes with over 40 creatures
that can be bent to your sick and twisted will. New "cows" can be
easily bred by those versed in the appropriate dark arts. Cowsay is more useful
than most of the items found in SkyMall catalogues, and a lot less expensive.

cat << EOF
Docker is an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a
lightweight container.

Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means
they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and
everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular language,
framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks for
deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without depending on a particular stack or provider.

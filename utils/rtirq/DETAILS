cat << EOF
The rtirq script is a bash script written by Rui Nuno Capela which works
in conjunction with the realtime kernel patch by Ingo Molnar. The script
takes advantage of the fact that realtime kernels use threads for IRQs
management, and as such these threads (like any other thread running on
your system) can be given maximum priority in an effort to minimize the
latency of audio peripherals. The script identifies the audio devices
present on the machine and raises the priority of the threads that handle
the IRQs of such devices.

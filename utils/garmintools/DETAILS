This software provides Linux users with the ability to communicate with the
Garmin Forerunner 305 via the USB interface. While this is the only Garmin
unit that I own, I did implement all of the documented Garmin protocols as
of Rev C (May 19, 2006) over the USB physical link. This means that if you
have a Garmin with a USB connection to a PC, you ought to be able to use
this software to communicate with it.

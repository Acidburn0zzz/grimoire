Linux has always been able to show how much I/O was going on (the bi and bo
columns of the vmstat 1 command).

Iotop is a Python program with a top like UI used to show of behalf of which
process is the I/O going on. It requires Python 2.5 and a Linux kernel
2.6.20 with the TASK_DELAY_ACCT and TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING options enabled.

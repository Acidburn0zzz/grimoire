QEMU achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation.
QEMU has two operating modes:

    * Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system 
    (for example a PC), including a processor and various peripherials. 
    It can be used to launch different Operating Systems without 
    rebooting the PC or to debug system code.
    * User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can 
    launch Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.

findwild is (yet another) utility program to search for files. It works
quite differently from other file search programs you have seen. It has a
GUI interface and can recall past searches.

The following search criteria are available:

directory path to search, with multiple wildcards ( * ? ) placed anywhere
file name(s) to search for, with multiple wildcards anywhere file name(s)
to exclude, with multiple wildcards anywhere file content string(s) to search
for, with multiple wildcards anywhere file content string(s) to exclude, with
multiple wildcards anywhere file creation/modification date within a desired
range your choice of delimiters for search strings (defaults provided) search
the list of files produced by the previous search Programmers may find this
program useful to search a large source library for references to a symbolic
name (e.g. find linux header file for a particular function or symbol).

All log files rotated by newsyslog are compressed, with the choice of either
gzip-style zlib compression or bzip2 compression. newsyslog also has the
ability to run an analyze program on the log file (usually useful to scan
the log for anomalous entries and report them, perhaps by sending a report
in e-mail), and to run a filter program on the log before archiving it and
only archiving the output from the filter (so that the uninteresting lines
can be stripped out before archiving). It also has the standard features that
you'd expect in a log rotation program, such as being able to save a given
number of old copies of a log and running commands to stop and restart the
service around the log rotation.

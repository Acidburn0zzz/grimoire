cat << EOF
Most of the existing tools for searching through large amounts of text are
either fast but inflexible (the original grep) or slightly more flexible but
slow or complicated to install.

sift is an alternative that aims for both speed and flexibility - i.e. adding
features while trying to reach (or even surpass) the performance of the
original grep.

The additional features include gitignore support, conditions (e.g. match A
only when preceded by B within X lines) , full multi-core support and multiline
matching.

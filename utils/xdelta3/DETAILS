Xdelta3 is an application program designed to compute changes between files.
These changes (deltas) are similar to the output of the "diff" program in that
they may be used to store and transmit only the changes between files.  However,
unlike diff, the output of Xdelta3 is not expressed in a human-readable format

Xdelta3 can also also apply these deltas to a copy of the original file.

Xdelta3 uses a fast, linear algorithm and performs well on both binary and text
files.

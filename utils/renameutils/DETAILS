The file renaming utilities (renameutils for short) are a set of programs
designed to make renaming of files faster and less cumbersome.

The file renaming utilities consists of five programs - qmv, qcp, imv,
icp and deurlname.

The qmv ("quick move") program allows file names to be edited in a text
editor. The names of all files in a directory are written to a text file,
which is then edited by the user. The text file is read and parsed, and the
changes are applied to the files.

The qcp ("quick cp") program works like qmv, but copies files instead of
moving them.

The imv ("interactive move") program, is trivial but useful when you are too
lazy to type (or even complete) the name of the file to rename twice. It
allows a file name to be edited in the terminal using the GNU Readline
library. icp copies files.

The deurlname program removes URL encoded characters (such as %20 representing
space) from file names. Some programs such as w3m tend to keep those characters
encoded in saved files.

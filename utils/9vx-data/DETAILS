9vx is a port of the plan 9 operating system to 
freebsd, linux, and os x, using the vx32 sandboxing
library to run "user" programs.  9vx runs as an
ordinary user program, but behaves like a separate
vm running plan 9.  it makes host resources like 
the file system, network stack, graphics windows,
and audio devices available as file systems.

9vx requires no host kernel modifications or
special privileges, and it runs unmodified 
plan9 386 binaries.

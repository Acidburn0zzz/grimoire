These days, it may seem pointless having yet another spreadsheet program (and
one that doesn't even know how to load Microsoft Excel files). Its compact size
(130k for the ncurses executable, 140k for the GUI executable, 300k for the
self-contained Windows EXE) and the fact that it can run across serial lines
and SSH sessions make it an interesting choice for embedded applications and as
system administration utility, even more so since it has a batch processing
mode and comes with example code for creating graphs from data sets.

Another interesting feature is its modern approach to spread sheet theory: It
sports true three-dimensional tables and iterative expressions. And since it
breaks compatibility with the usual notions of big spreadsheet packages, it can
also throw old syntactic cruft over board which many spreadsheets still inherit
from the days of VisiCalc on ancient CP/M systems.

915resolution is a tool to modify the video BIOS of the 800 and 900 series Intel 
graphics chipsets. This includes the 845G, 855G, and 865G chipsets, as well as 915G, 
915GM, and 945G chipsets. This modification is neccessary to allow the display of 
certain graphics resolutions for an Xorg or XFree86 graphics server. 
 915resolution's modifications of the BIOS are transient. There is no risk of 
permanent modification of the BIOS. This also means that 915resolution must be run 
every time the computer boots inorder for it's changes to take effect.

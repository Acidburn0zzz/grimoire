A code-searching tool similar to ack, but faster
What's so great about Ag?
It is an order of magnitude faster than ack.
It ignores file patterns from your .gitignore and .hgignore.
If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search, just add their patterns to 
a .agignore file. (*cough* extern *cough*)
The command name is 33% shorter than ack, and all keys are on the home row!

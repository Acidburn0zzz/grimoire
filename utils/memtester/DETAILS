memtest is a utility for testing the memory subsystem in a computer to determine
if it is faulty.

The original source was by Simon Kirby. The program has been rewritten by
Charles Cazabon and many additional tests were added to help catch borderline
memory. He also rewrote the original tests (which catch mainly memory bits which
are stuck permanently high or low) so that they run approximately an order of
magnitude faster.

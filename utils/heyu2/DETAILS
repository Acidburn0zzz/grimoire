cat << EOF
HEYU provides a command line interface to communicate with the CM11A 
hardware module from X10. The CM11A will send remote control signals over 
the power lines to remote modules within your house. HEYU can be run from 
cron to automate lights, sprinklers, etc., or can store macros and timers in 
the CM11A memory for standalone operation. Auxiliary input from several X10 RF 
receiver devices is supported. Arbitrary commands and scripts can be launched 
based on X10 signals and the state of the system.

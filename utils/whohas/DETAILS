whohas is a command line tool that allows you to query several package
collections at once. It currently supports Arch, Debian, Gentoo, and Slackware
repositories. whohas was designed to help package maintainers find ebuilds,
pkgbuilds, and similar package definitions from other distributions to learn
from. However, it can also be used by normal users who want to know which
distribution provides certain packages, and which version of a given package
is in use in each distribution or in each release of a distribution.

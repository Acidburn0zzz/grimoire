This systems administrator, tuner and benchmark tool gives you a huge amount
of important performance information in one go. It can output the data in
two ways:

   1. On screen (console, telnet, VNC, putty or X Windows) using curses for low
      CPU impact which is updated once every two seconds. You hit a single
      characters on you keyboard to enable/disable the various sorts of data.
       * You can display the CPU, memory, network, disks (mini graphs or
         numbers), file systems, NFS, top processes, resources (Linux version &
         processors) and on Power micro-partition information.
   2. Save the data to a comma separated file for analysis and longer term
         data capture.
       * Use this together with nmon Analyser Excel 2000 spreadsheet, which
         loads the nmon output file and automatically creates dozens of graphs
         ready for you to study or write performance reports.
       * Filter this data, add it to a rrd database (using an excellent freely
         available utility called rrdtool). This graphs the data to .gif or
         .png files plus generates the webpage .html file and you can then put
         the graphs directly on a website automatically on AIX with no need of
         a Windows based machine.
       * Directly put the data into a rrd database or other database for your
         own analysis

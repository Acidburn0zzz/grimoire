cat << EOF
The National Weather Service has provided it's METAR
Decoder Software Package to the public. The MDSP Library
is a repackaging and modification of the original MDSP to
compile and run on BSD and Linux (and pretty much any other OS).

The MDSP Library provides a programmer with two functions,
the major one being DcdMETAR, which decodes a METAR into structures
provided by the library. Also prtDMETR, which prints out a decoded
METAR structure.

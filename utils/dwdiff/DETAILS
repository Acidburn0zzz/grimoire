dwdiff is a front-end for the diff program that operates at the word level
instead of the line level. It is different from wdiff in that it allows
the user to specify what should be considered whitespace, and in that it
takes an optional list of characters that should be considered delimiters.
Delimiters are single characters that are treated as if they are words, even
when there is no whitespace separating them from preceding words or delimiters.
dwdiff is mostly commandline compatible with wdiff.  The default output
from dwdiff is the new text, with the deleted and inserted parts annotated
with markers.  Command line options are available to change both what is
printed and the markers.

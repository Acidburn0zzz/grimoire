MultiTail lets you view one or multiple files like the original tail 
program. The difference is that it creates multiple windows on your
console (with ncurses). Merging of 2 or more log files is possible.
It can also use colors while displaying the log files (through regular
expressions) for faster recognition of what is important. It can also
filter lines (again with regular expressions). It has interactive menus for
editing given regular expressions and deleting and adding windows. One can
also have windows with the output of shell scripts and other software.
When viewing the output of external software, MultiTail can mimic the
functionality of tools like 'watch'.

Winetricks is an easy way to work around problems in Wine.

It has a menu of supported games/apps for which it can do all the workarounds
automatically. It also lets you install missing DLLs or tweak various Wine
settings individually.

It can be used via gui or commandline, whichever you prefer; the commandline
mode is particularly useful as a building block in fancier wine frontends and
in automated regression testing.

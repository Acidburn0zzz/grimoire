cat << EOF
NCMatrix is a modified version of the CMatrix screen saver by Chris Allegretta
with the added functionality of network traffic monitoring. As network activity
changes, different colored characters will be displayed at random locations in
the streams. Depending on the size of the packet, the length of the character
stream will change as well.

cat << EOF
inotify-tools is a C library and a set of command-line programs for Linux that provides 
a simple interface to inotify. 
These programs can be used to monitor and act upon filesystem events. 
A more detailed description of the programs is further down the page. The programs are written in C and have no dependencies other than a Linux kernel supporting inotify.

inotify-tools includes:
* inotifywait: This program just blocks for inotify events. 
					It can watch any set of files and directories, 
					and can recursively watch entire directory trees.
* inotifywatch: 
					inotifywatch collects filesystem usage statistics and outputs counts
					of each inotify event.

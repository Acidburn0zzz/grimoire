# /etc/rsyslog.conf: rsyslogd configuration file
#
# rsyslog is considered a part of Adiscon's MonitorWare product line.
# As such, you can find current information as well as information on the
# other product line members on http://www.monitorware.com. Please be warned, there
# are a number of closed-source commercial Windows applications among these products ;)
#
# You might want to check the GPL'd phpLogCon as a web-based front-end to a syslog
# message database.
#
# I hope you find this work useful!

# If you do not load inputs, nothing happens!
# You may need to set the module load path if modules are not found.

$ModLoad imuxsock.so # provides support for local system logging (e.g. via logger command)
$ModLoad imklog.so # kernel logging (formerly provided by rklogd)

# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!

# Remote Logging (we use TCP for reliable delivery)

# down, messages are spooled to disk and sent when it is up again.

######### Receiving Messages from Remote Hosts ##########

# See http://rsyslog.com/doc for more information and examples
#
# TCP Syslog Server:
# provides TCP syslog reception and GSS-API (if compiled to support it)
#
#$ModLoad imtcp.so  # load module

# Note: as of now, you need to use the -t command line option to
# enable TCP reception (e.g. -t514 to run a server at port 514/tcp)
# This will change in later v3 releases.

# UDP Syslog Server:
#
#$ModLoad imudp.so  # provides UDP syslog reception
#$UDPServerRun 514 # start a UDP syslog server at standard port 514

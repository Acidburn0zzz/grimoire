Previously known as Fig.

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications with
Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file,
then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that
needs to be done to get it running.

Compose is great for development environments, staging servers, and CI.

Using Compose is basically a three-step process.
* Define your app's environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced
  anywhere.
* Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can
  be run together in an isolated environment:
* Lastly, run docker-compose up and Compose will start and run your entire app.

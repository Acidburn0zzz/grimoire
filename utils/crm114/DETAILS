CRM114 is a system to examine incoming e-mail, system log streams, data files
or other data streams, and to sort, filter, or alter the incoming files or
data streams according to the user's wildest desires. Criteria for
categorization of data can be via a host of methods, including regexes,
approximate regexes, a Hidden Markov Model, Orthogonal Sparse Bigrams, WINNOW,
Correllation, KNN/Hyperspace, or Bit Entropy (or by other means - it's all
programmable).

Accuracy has been seen in excess of 99.9 per cent. In other words,
CRM114 learns, and it learns fast.

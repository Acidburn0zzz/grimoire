cat << EOF
Micron is a simple, small and secure cron daemon. The goal of Micron has been to
create a Vixie-Cron replacement that is more secure and does not rely on e-mail
as the only way of receiving job output.

Features:
 * Small code and executable size
 * A system crontab file for running system maintenance tasks
 * Removal of the stupid useless features that Vixie-Cron added to the crontab
   file format.
 * Crontab file syntax that is compatible with the original crontab file syntax.
 * Full privilege de-escalation for any executed job; this eliminates any way of
   running code as root unless you have write-access to root's crontab.
 * Way of selecting where job output should be saved possible targets are:
   syslog, logfile, mail, /dev/null, and stdout (only useful if running the cron
   daemon in debug mode).

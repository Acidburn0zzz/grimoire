message "\n${MESSAGE_COLOR}If you don't have an xorg.conf, you don't have to \
do anything and it should work out-of-the-box.\n
The X-server must _not_ be configured to a specific mouse device like \
/dev/input/mouse0, because on configuration events razerd may have to \
temporarly unregister the mouse from the system. This will confuse the \
X-server, if it's configured to a specific device.\n
Configure it to the generic /dev/input/mice device instead. This will enable \
the X-server to pick up the mouse again after a configuration event from \
razerd.\n${DEFAULT_COLOR}"

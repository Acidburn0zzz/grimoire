Wine-doors is an application designed to make installing windows software on
Linux, Solaris or other Unix systems easier. Wine-doors is essentially a
package management tool for windows software on Linux systems. Most Linux
desktop users are familiar with package management style application delivery,
so it made sense to apply this model to windows software.

Wine-doors works by leveraging the exquisite software, libraries and tools
created over at WineHQ, there are also plans to support Cedega, cvscedega and
Crossover Office.

Wine-doors is developed and styled to fit in with the GNOME desktop but is
fairly portable and a user interface could be developed for KDE. As a GNOME
application Wine-doors employs pygtk, glade and cairo to represent itself to
the user, we also endeavour to follow the tango style guidelines for
application icon artwork.

Aside from this the main goals of wine-doors are as follows:
  * Replace winetools
  * Allow flexible application management
  * Provide Queue processing capability
  * Provide Application Database integration
  * Avoid global native overrides
  * Automatically add items to the desktop menus
  * Allow users to manage their windows applications with profiles and bottles

Canonical's on-screen-display notification agent, implementing the
freedesktop.org Desktop Notifications Specification with semi-transparent
click-through bubbles.

The freedesktop.org Desktop Notifications Specification provides a standard
way for applications to display pop-up notifications. These are designed to
make you aware of something, without interrupting your work with a window
you must close.

Notify OSD presents these notifications as ephemeral overlays, which can
be clicked through so they don't block your work. It queues notifications,
to prevent them from flooding your screen. And as well as handling standard
notification updates, Notify OSD introduces the idea of appending -- allowing
notifications to grow over time, for example in the case of instant messages
from a particular person.

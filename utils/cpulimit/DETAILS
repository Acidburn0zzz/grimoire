cat << EOF
cpulimit is a simple program that attempts to limit the cpu usage of a process
(expressed in percentage, not in cpu time). This is useful to control batch
jobs, when you don't want them to eat too much cpu.
It does not act on the nice value or other scheduling priority stuff, but
on the real cpu usage. Also, it is able to adapt itself to the overall
system load, dynamically and quickly

For the technical interested: It sends SIGSTOP/CONT in a timed manner to let the
process sleep part-time.

LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features.
Through a powerful API and simple tools, it lets Linux users easily create
and manage system or application containers.  Features

Current LXC uses the following kernel features to contain processes:
* Kernel namespaces (ipc, uts, mount, pid, network and user)
* Apparmor and SELinux profiles
* Seccomp policies
* Chroots (using pivot_root)
* Kernel capabilities
* Control groups (cgroups)

As such, LXC is often considered as something in the middle between a chroot
on steroids and a full fledged virtual machine. The goal of LXC is to create
an environment as close as possible as a standard Linux installation but
without the need for a separate kernel.

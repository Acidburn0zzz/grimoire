cat << EOF
bsdiff and bspatch are tools for building and applying patches to binary files.
By using suffix sorting (specifically, Larsson and Sadakane's qsufsort) and 
taking advantage of how executable files change, bsdiff routinely produces 
binary patches 50-80% smaller than those produced by Xdelta, and 15% smaller 
than those produced by .RTPatch.

cat << EOF
flashrom is a utility for identifying, reading, writing, verifying and erasing
flash chips. It's often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware images.
  - Supports more than 205 flash chips, 75 chipsets, 130 mainboards, and 17
    devices (PCI or USB) which can be used as external programmers.
  - Supports parallel, LPC, FWH and SPI flash interfaces and various chip
    packages (DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32, TSOP40, TSOP48, and more)
  - No physical access needed, root access is sufficient.
  - No bootable floppy disk, bootable CD-ROM or other media needed.
  - No keyboard or monitor needed. Simply reflash remotely via SSH.
  - No instant reboot needed. Reflash your chip in a running system, verify it,
    be happy. The new firmware will be present next time you boot.
  - Crossflashing and hotflashing is possible as long as the flash chips are
    electrically and logically compatible (same protocol). Great for recovery.
  - Scriptability. Reflash a whole pool of identical machines at the same time
    from the command line. It is recommended to check flashrom output and error
    codes.
  - Speed. flashrom is often much faster than most vendor flash tools.
  - Portability. Supports DOS, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Solaris,
    Mac OS X, and other Unix-like OSes. Partial Windows support is available,
    and full Windows support exists as a patch.

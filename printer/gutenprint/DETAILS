Gutenrint is a collection of very high quality printer drivers for
UNIX/Linux. The goal of this project is uncompromising print quality and
robustness. Included with this package is the Print plugin for the GIMP
(hence the name), a CUPS driver, and a driver for Ghostscript that may be
compiled into that package. This driver package is Foomatic-compatible to
enable plug and play with many print spoolers. In addition, various printer
maintenance utilities are included. Many users report that the quality of
Gimp-Print on high end Epson Stylus printers matches or exceeds the quality
of the drivers supplied for Windows and Macintosh.

NOTE:  the three spells cups, espgs and gimp-print represent a circular
  dependency relationship.  If you want all three spells installed, cast
  espgs first, answering n to gimp-print.  Then cast cups.  Then cast espgs
  again with the -r -c options and answer y to gimp-print and y to
  gimp-prints optional_depends of cups.  Like so:
  
  cast espgs        # No to gimp-print
  cast cups
  cast -r -c espgs  # Yes to gimp-print and yes to cups

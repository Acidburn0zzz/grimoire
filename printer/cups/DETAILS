CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX-based operating systems.
It was developed to promote a standard printing solution. It is the standard
printing system in Mac OS X and most Linux distributions.
CUPS uses the  Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis for managing
print jobs and queues and adds network printer browsing and PostScript Printer
Description ("PPD") based printing options to support real-world printing.

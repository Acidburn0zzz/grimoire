PDFjam is a small collection of shell scripts which provide a simple interface
to some of the functionality of the excellent pdfpages package (by Andreas
Matthias) for pdfLaTeX. At present the utilities available are:

    * pdfnup, which allows PDF files to be "n-upped" in roughly the
      way that psnup does for PostScript files.
    * pdfjoin, which concatenates the pages of multiple PDF files
      together into a single file
    * pdf90, which rotates the pages of one or more PDF files through
      90 degrees (anti-clockwise).

In every case, source files are left unchanged.

The iwlwifi project provides a driver which utilizes the new mac80211 subsystem
for the Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN and Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG
Network Connection adapters.

In addition to using the new mac80211 subsystem, this project uses a new
microcode image which removes the need for the user space regulatory daemon
(such as ipw3945 uses). This change should help to simplify installation,
development, and redistribution of this driver package.

NOTE: The iwlwifi driver is a development driver. If you are looking for a
fully validated and stable driver, please visit the Intel Customer Support
download page

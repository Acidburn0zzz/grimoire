	* BUILD: Fails the first time if it has to regenerate the Makefile
	  The error denoting this state is: "Makefile has been modified by
	  generate_compatible, please run `make' again"

2007-11-22 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: Updated to 1.2.0

2007-10-20 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DEPENDS: Only needs mac80211 for 2.6.22 and older
	* CONFLICTS: Conflicts with mac80211 for 2.6.23 and newer, since it's
	  now in the kernel
	* PRE_BUILD: Check for CONFIG_FW_LOADER and CONFIG_MAC80211

	* DEPENDS: Nope, it just doesn't work often and it happened to be a
	  fluke that iwlwifi worked again after installing ieee80211. Only
	  needs mac80211

2007-10-08 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DEPENDS: Also seems to depend on ieee80211 to work properly

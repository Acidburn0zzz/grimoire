	* DETAILS: Updated to 1.2.22
	* BUILD: KSRC is the proper way to define what kernel to use to compile
	  Set KVER as well, just in case
	* INSTALL: KMISC is the proper way to define what kernel to install to
	  Need to set KVER for their run of depmod
	* FINAL: Run depmod on the correct kernel version

2007-11-27 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: Fails the first time if it has to regenerate the Makefile
	  The error denoting this state is: "Makefile has been modified by
	  generate_compatible, please run `make' again"

2007-11-22 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: Updated to 1.2.0

	* DEPENDS: Nope, it just doesn't work often and it happened to be a
	  fluke that iwlwifi worked again after installing ieee80211.
	  Only needs mac80211

2007-10-08 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DEPENDS: Also seems to depend on ieee80211 to work properly

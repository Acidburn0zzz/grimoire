	* DEPENDS: Only needs mac80211 for 2.6.21 and older
	* CONFLICTS: Conflicts with mac80211 for 2.6.22 and newer, since it's
	  now in the kernel

	* DEPENDS: Nope, it just doesn't work often and it happened to be a
	  fluke that iwlwifi worked again after installing ieee80211. Only
	  needs mac80211

2007-10-08 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DEPENDS: Also seems to depend on ieee80211 to work properly

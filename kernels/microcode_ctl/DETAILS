The microcode_ctl utility is a companion to the IA32 microcode driver written
by Tigran Aivazian <tigran@veritas.com>. The utility has two uses:

a) it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel driver to be uploaded
   to Intel IA32 family processors. (Pentium Pro, PII, Celeron, PIII, Xeon
   Pentium 4 etc.)
b) it signals the kernel driver to release any buffers it may hold

The microcode update is volatile and needs to be uploaded on each system
boot i.e. it doesn't reflash your cpu permanently, reboot and it reverts
back to the old microcode.

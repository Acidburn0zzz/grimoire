QEMU achieves a good emulation speed by using dynamic translation.
QEMU has two operating modes:

    * Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system 
    (for example a PC), including a processor and various peripherials. 
    It can be used to launch different Operating Systems without 
    rebooting the PC or to debug system code.
    * User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can 
    launch Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. 

KQEMU is the kernel accelerator module for qemu. Substantially improves 
performance.

Emulator     : Typical Slowdown Ratio
QEMU         : between 5 and 10
QEMU + Accel : between 1 and 2

Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)

The DRM is a kernel module that gives direct hardware access to DRI clients.

This module deals with DMA, AGP memory management, resource locking, and secure
hardware access. In order to support multiple, simultaneous 3D applications the
3D graphics hardware must be treated as a shared resource. Locking is required
to provide mutual exclusion. DMA transfers and the AGP interface are used to
send buffers of graphics commands to the hardware. Finally, there must be
security to prevent out-of-control clients from crashing the hardware.

	* INSTALL: no longer needs to install the nouveau header

	* CONFIGURE: added nouveau
	* INSTALL: sure there is... it's always good to be verbos in installs
	  I hate installs that don't output anything... I always wonder if
	  something broke at that point.

2006-09-22 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* PRE_INSTALL: Remove backup of kernel modules
	* INSTALL: No need to be verbose when calling mkdir
	  Use get_kernel_version rather than uname

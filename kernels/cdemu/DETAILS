CDemu is a kernel module for Linux. It is designed to simulate a CD drive + CD with just simple cue/bin files, which are pretty common in the Windows world. It includes an user space program to control the kernel module. You can use it to watch an SVCD or mount the data track of an bin/cue. However, for watching an SVCD, we would recommend MPlayer which can play bin/cue images directly with the patch a friend and I made for it (more under History). The CDemu project is licensed under the GPL (v2 or later) !

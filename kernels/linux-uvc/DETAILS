This is the USB Video Class Linux device driver.

The USB Device Class Definition for Video Devices, or USB Video Class,
defines video streaming functionality on the Universal Serial Bus. Much like
nearly all mass storage devices (USB flash disks, external IDE disk
enclosures, ...) can be managed by a single driver because they conform to
the USB Mass Storage specification, UVC compliant peripherals only need a
generic driver.

The UVC specification covers webcams, digital camcorders, analog video
converters, analog and digital television tuners, and still-image cameras
that support video streaming for both video input and output.

Due to the limited available man power and the broad scope of the UVC
specification, the Linux UVC project will concentrate the development
efforts on video input devices, especially webcams. Video output devices
will be considered at a later time.

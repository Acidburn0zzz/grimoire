cat << EOF
mcelog is the user space backend for logging machine check errors
reported by the hardware to the kernel. The kernel does the immediate
actions (like killing processes etc.) and mcelog decodes the logs
the errors.

It primarily handles machine checks and thermal events, which
are reported for errors detected by the CPU.

It is recommended that mcelog runs on all x86 machines, both
64-bit (since early 2.6) and 32-bit (since 2.6.32)

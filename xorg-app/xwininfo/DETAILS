xwininfo is a utility for displaying information about windows.
Various information is displayed depending on which options are
selected. The user has the option of selecting the target window with
the mouse or by specifying its window id on the command line with the
-id option. There is also a special -root option to quickly obtain
information on the screen's root window.

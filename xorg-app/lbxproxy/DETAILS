Applications that would like to take advantage of the Low Bandwidth extension to
X (LBX) must make their connections to an lbxproxy. These applications need to
know nothing about LBX, they simply connect to the lbxproxy as if were a regular
server. The lbxproxy accepts client connections, multiplexes them over a single
connection to the X server, and performs various optimizations on the X protocol
to make it faster over low bandwidth and/or high latency connections.

NOTE: This application is deprecated.

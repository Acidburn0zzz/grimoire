cat << EOF
kbd  is  an  Xorg  input driver for keyboards.  The driver supports the
standard OS-provided keyboard interface, but these are  currently  only
available  to  this  driver  module  for Linux, BSD, and Solaris.  This
driver is planned to replace the built-in keyboard driver in  a  future
release of Xorg.

The kbd driver functions as a keyboard input device, and may be used as
the X server's core keyboard.

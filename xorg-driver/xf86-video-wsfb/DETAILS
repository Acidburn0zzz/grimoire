           SHORT="Xorg driver for OpenBSD and NetBSD wsdisplay framebuffer devices"
cat << EOF
wsfb is an Xorg driver for OpenBSD and NetBSD wsdisplay framebuffer devices.

This is a non-accelerated driver.

The following framebuffer depths are supported: 1, 8, 16 and 24, given that
the wsdisplay device underneath supports them.

Multi-head configurations are supported.

The wsfb driver supports all hardware where a wsdisplay framebuffer driver
is available on OpenBSD and NetBSD. On OpenBSD, currently this includes
OpenBSD/macppc, OpenBSD/sparc, OpenBSD/sparc64 and OpenBSD/alpha on TGA
graphics cards. It also supports NetBSD/i386 using wsdisplay on vesafb(4).

The X driver responsible for translating the input events generated by the 
kernel driver into XInput events that the X server can understand and relay to
running applications. It is also responsible for virtualizing the single 
hardware device to appear as multiple logical devices (e.g. stylus, eraser, 
touch). This grants applications like GIMP access to extended functionality 
like pressure and high-resolution coordinates.

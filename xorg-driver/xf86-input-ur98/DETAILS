cat << EOF
UR-98 is an Xorg input driver for the Union Reality UR-F98 headtracker.

The UR-98 driver functions as a pointer input device, and can  be  used
either as an additional input device or as the X server's core pointer.
The driver provides support for the three axes, throttle and four  but-
tons  of  the controller. If mapped as the core pointer the headtracker
provides headtracking to try and place the mouse cursor where you look.
As  a secondary input device the unit can be used for gaming, for exam-
ple to provide the look up/down and the turn in quake, and with  the  Z
axis bound to ack/forward to provide movement control.

The  default mapping maps left-right movement to X, up-down movement to
Y and near/far movement to the Z axis. The throttle is  mapped  as  the
fourth axis by default but can also be mapped as button 5.

For  use in "head only" mode the Z axis can be mapped as a button. This
allows the user to select objects with  head/neck  movement  alone  but
takes some practice to use well.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
Union  Reality  UR-98. While this is a joystick driver the behaviour is
absolute so this driver is not useful for true joystick interfaces.

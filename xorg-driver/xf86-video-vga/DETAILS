cat << EOF
vga  is  an Xorg driver for generic VGA video cards.  It can drive most
VGA-compatible video cards, but only makes use of  the  basic  standard
VGA  core that is common to these cards.  The driver supports depths 1,
4 and 8.  All relevant  visual  types  are  supported  at  each  depth.
Multi-head  configurations are supported in combination with some other
drivers, but only when the vga driver is driving the primary head.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The vga driver supports most VGA-compatible  video  cards.   There  are
some known exceptions, and those should be listed here.

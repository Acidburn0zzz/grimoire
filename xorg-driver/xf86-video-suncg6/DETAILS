The XOrg Foundation, (a.k.a. X.org) has changed to an Open Source model to
maintain the official Public Implementation of X11.

The XOrg Foundation invites anyone who has an interest to join in. Anyone
may create and work on a branch in the repository. See XOrgRepository for
more information about the XOrg Foundation repository.

The repository consists of an imported XFree86 tree that is very close
to their 4.4 release. Just before its 4.4 release, XFree86 adopted a
new licensing scheme incompatible with the GPL. For this reason, we have
recreated its tree as closely as possible without importing files affected
by the new license. Our tree is being referred to as simply "XOrg", and a
public release will be made shortly.

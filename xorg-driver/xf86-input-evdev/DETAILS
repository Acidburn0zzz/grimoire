cat << EOF
evdev is an Xorg input driver for LinuxÂ´s generic event devices. It
therefore supports all input devices that the kernel knows about,
including most mice and keyboards.

The evdev driver can serve as both a pointer and a keyboard input
device, and may be used as both the core keyboard and the core pointer.
Multiple input devices are supported by multiple instances of this
driver, with one Load directive for evdev in the Module section of your
xorg.conf for each input device that will use this driver.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
In general, any input device that the kernel has a driver for can be
accessed through the evdev driver. See the Linux kernel documentation
for a complete list.

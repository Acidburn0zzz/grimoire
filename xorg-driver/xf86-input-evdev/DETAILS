           SHORT="evdev  is  an  Xorg input driver for Linux generic event devices."
cat << EOF
evdev  is  an  Xorg input driver for LinuxÂ´s generic event devices.  It
therefore supports all input  devices  that  the  kernel  knows  about,
including most mice and keyboards.

The  evdev  driver  can  serve  as  both a pointer and a keyboard input
device, and may be used as both the core keyboard and the core pointer.
Multiple  input  devices  are  supported  by multiple instances of this
driver, with one Load directive for evdev in the Module section of your
xorg.conf for each input device that will use this driver.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
In  general,  any  input device that the kernel has a driver for can be
accessed through the evdev driver.  See the Linux kernel  documentation
for a complete list.

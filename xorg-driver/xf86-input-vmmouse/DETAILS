cat << EOF
vmmouse  is  an  XFree86 input driver for mice.  The driver supports most
available mouse types and interfaces.  USB mice are only  supported  on
some OSs, and the level of support for PS/2 mice depends on the OS.

The  mouse  driver functions as a pointer input device, and may be used
as the X server's core pointer.  Multiple mice are supported by  multiple
instances of this driver.

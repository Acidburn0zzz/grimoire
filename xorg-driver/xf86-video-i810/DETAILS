i810  is  an  Xorg  driver for Intel integrated graphics chipsets.  The
driver supports depths 8, 15, 16 and 24.  All  visual  types  are  sup-
ported  in  depth  8.  For the i810/i815 other depths support the True-
Color and DirectColor visuals.  For the i830M and later, only the True-
Color  visual  is supported for depths greater than 8.  The driver sup-
ports hardware accelerated 3D via the Direct  Rendering  Infrastructure
(DRI),  but only in depth 16 for the i810/i815 and depths 16 and 24 for
the 830M and later.

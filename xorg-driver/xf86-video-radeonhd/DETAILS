Radeon HD video driver based on the AMD/ATI driver for which AMD
released the source and the register specs.
The RadeonHD 1.0.0 driver officially supports the ATI RV505, RV515,
RV516, R520, RV530, RV535, RV570, R580, RS690, R600, RV610, and RV620
chip families. The RV670 / Radeon HD 3800 series hasn't been officially
tested, but may be supported as well. This current driver has full
mode-setting support with dual-head capabilities and is RandR 1.2
compliant. While there is full modesetting support and hardware
cursor acceleration, both 2D and 3D acceleration are not available
in this release.

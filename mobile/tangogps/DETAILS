tangoGPS is a lightweight and fast mapping application. It runs on handheld
devices like the Openmoko Neo1973 as well as on the desktop. By default is
uses map data from the OpenStreetMap.org project.

Maps are automagically downloaded and cached for offline use while you drag
or zoom the map.

.  If connected to a GPS your current position and track are shown on the map
and you can log positional data for further processing, i.e. for geocoding
photos or uploading streets to Openstreetmap.

A basic friend finder function lets you exchange your position with others.

.  Technology

tangoGPS is a GTK+ application fully developed on the desktop and then simply
crosscompiled for the Neo. It is written in C and uses the following libs:

    * GdkPixbuf * gconf-2 * dbus * gthread * libcurl

All this works right out of the box on the Neo / OpenMoko - it's kind of
magic due to the openembedded build system used by OpenMoko.

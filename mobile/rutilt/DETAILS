RutilT is a Gtk+ program designed to set up any wireless network interface, find
and connect to networks in range and get some information such as the quality of
association  etc...   Althought primally written for Ralink devices, it supports
any Linux wireless extensions compliant  kernel  module.   Currently,  there  is
extra  support  for  the  following  modules (rt2x00 project's legacy drivers) :
rt2400, rt2500, rt2570, rt61 and rt73. rt2x00 itself  will  be  supported  in  a
future release.

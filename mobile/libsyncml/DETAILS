Libsyncml is a implementation of the SyncML protocol.

The goals of Libsyncml are:

    * Provide a reliable implementation of the syncml standard
    * Implement the Data Synchronization part. Optionally the
      Device Management part later
    * Size. Libsyncml should have a small footprint so that it can
      be used on mobile devices
    * Support of many transport bindings like http server
      and client and obex over IR, bluetooth etc
    * Support for wbxml using libwbxml
    * Direct parsing of wbxml without the need to convert wbxml into xml
    * Portability. The framework should run on as many platforms
      as possible (Linux, Windows, Mac OS, BSD, etc)
    * Easily usable from other languages. Libsyncml is written
      in c so that i can be embedded into other languages
    * Support for Syncml 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2

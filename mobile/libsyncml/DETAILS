Libsyncml is a implementation of the SyncML protocol.

The goals of Libsyncml are:

    * Provide a reliable implementation of the syncml standard * Implement the
    Data Synchronization part. Optionally the Device Management part later *
    Size. Libsyncml should have a small footprint so that it can be used on
    mobile devices * Support of many transport bindings like http server
    and client and obex over IR, bluetooth etc * Support for wbxml using
    libwbxml * Direct parsing of wbxml without the need to convert wbxml
    into xml * Portability. The framework should run on as many platforms
    as possible (Linux, Windows, Mac OS, BSD, etc) * Easily usable from
    other languages. Libsyncml is written in c so that i can be embedded
    into other languages * Support for Syncml 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2

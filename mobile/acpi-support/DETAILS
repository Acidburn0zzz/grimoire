This source is shared between acpi-support-base and acpi-support,
both get installed by the spell, :).

acpi-support-base contains scripts to react to various base ACPI events
such as the power-button.  For more extensive ACPI support, including
support for suspend-to-RAM and for various laptop features, see
acpi-support

acpi-support contains scripts to react to various ACPI events.  It only
includes scripts for events that can be supported with some level of
safety cross platform.  It is able to:

 * Detect loss and gain of AC power, lid closure, and the press of a
   number of specific buttons (on Asus, IBM, Lenovo, Panasonic, Sony
   and Toshiba laptops).
 * Suspend, hibernate and resume the computer, with workarounds for
   hardware that needs it.
 * On some laptops, set screen brightness.

cat << EOF
acpi-support contains scripts to react to various ACPI events.
It only includes scripts for events that can be supported with
some level of safety cross platform.

It is able to:

 * Detect loss and gain of AC power, lid closure, and the press of a
   number of specific buttons (on Asus, IBM, Lenovo, Panasonic, Sony
   and Toshiba laptops).
 * Suspend, hibernate and resume the computer, with workarounds for
   hardware that needs it.
 * On some laptops, set screen brightness.

Gammu (formerly known as MyGnokii2) is a cellular manager for various mobile
phones/modems. It supports a wide variety of Nokia, Symbian, and AT devices
(Siemens, Alcatel, Falcom, WaveCom, IPAQ, Samsung, SE, and others) over
cables, infrared, or BlueTooth. It contains libraries with functions for
ringtones, phonebook, SMS, logos, WAP, date/time, alarm, calls, and more
(used by external applications like Wammu). It also includes a command line
utility that can make many things (including backups) and an SMS gateway
with full MySQL and PostgreSQL support from the PHP interface.

cat << EOF
OpenSync is a synchronization framework that is platform and distribution
independent.  It consists of several plugins that can be used to connect to
devices, a powerful sync-engine and the framework itself.  The synchronization
framework is kept very flexible and is capable of synchronizing any type of
data, including contacts, calendar, tasks, notes and files.

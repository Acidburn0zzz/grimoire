CPUFreq is a Linux kernel subsystem which allows the clock speed of mobile
CPUs (most often found in laptop computers) to be explicitly set. CPUSpeed
dynamically controls CPUFreq, slowing down the CPU to conserve power and
reduce heat when the system is idle, on battery power or overheating,
and speeding up the CPU when the system is busy and more processing power
is needed. Using CPUSpeed can significantly increase a laptop computer's
battery life and significantly reduce the heat it generates while still
allowing your system to perform at top speed when you need it.

	* DEPENDS: Don't bother with --plugin-dir, as we'll install the plugin
	  ourselves
	* INSTALL: Install the plugin to all plugin folders, not just mozilla's

2007-04-27 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* CONFIGURE: Remove KDE option, it's no longer valid (even though it's
	  listed in ./configure --help)
	* DEPENDS: Set flags to enable dependencies
	  Use if/elif/fi for GUI selection, only need to check until we find one
	  (same with sound)
	  List hard dependencies first, then optional
	  Use depends -sub rather then depends && sub_depends
	  Properly format optional dependencies
	  Add missing description for NS-PLUGIN-COMPATIBLE
	  Only depends on OPENGL if using the OpenGL renderer (not Cairo or Agg)
	  Disable GLExt for non-GTK GUIs
	  Don't use cairo, it's experimental and doesn't even compile here :(
	  Remove KDE check
	* BUILD: Setting flags in OPTS now taken care of by DEPENDS
	  use get_spell_provider to find out which package is providing
	  NS-PLUGIN-COMPATIBLE and modify configure accordingly

	* PREPARE,CONFIGURE,DEPENDS,BUILD: fix some config values,
	  move questions to CONFIGURE, actually give gui and sound
	  option to configure; which would always demand gtk

cssed is a small developer editor and validator, that tries to ease the CSS
editing. It is an Open Source project, it means that you can download the
program but also its source.

It features syntax highlighting, syntax validation, MDI notebook based
interface, quick CSS properties and values insertion, auto-completion and
dialog-based insertion of CSS complex values.

Being a CSS editor, it's not limited to this language. cssed haved some
support for HTML (with embbeded Javascript), XML, Javascript, Java, PHP,
JSP, C, C++, Apache configuration files, .htaccess, Python, Perl, SQL,
SH and other languages so it can serve quite well as multi-purpose editor.

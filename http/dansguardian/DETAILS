DansGuardian is a web content filter which currently runs on Linux, 
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X, HP-UX, and Solaris.  It filters the 
actual content of pages based on many methods including phrase matching, 
PICS filtering, and URL filtering.  It does not purely filter based on a 
banned list of sites like lesser totally commercial filters.

DansGuardian is designed to be completely flexible and allows you to 
tailor the filtering to your exact needs.  It can be as draconian or as 
unobstructive as you want.  The default settings are geared towards what 
a primary school might want byt DansGuardian puts you in control of what 
you want to block

DansGuardian is a true web content filter

This is not a full-blown proxy.  It must connect to an actual proxy, 
such as squid.  Squid is strongly recommended in addition to this spell.

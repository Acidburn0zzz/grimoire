cat << EOF
rpaf is for backend Apache servers what mod_proxy_add_forward is for frontend
Apache servers. It does excactly the opposite of mod_proxy_add_forward written
by Ask BjÃ¸rn Hansen.

It changes the remote address of the client visible to other Apache modules
when two conditions are satisfied. First condition is that the remote client
is actually a proxy that is defined in httpd.conf.  Secondly if there is an
incoming X-Forwarded-For header and the proxy is in it's list of known
proxies it takes the last IP from the incoming X-Forwarded-For header and
changes the remote address of the client in the request structure. It also
takes the incoming X-Host header and updates the virtualhost settings
accordingly. For Apache2 mod_proxy it takes the X-Forwared-Host header and
updates the virtualhosts.

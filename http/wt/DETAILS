Wt (we pronounce that as 'witty') is a C++ library for developing interactive
web applications.

The API is widget-centric and uses well-tested patterns of desktop GUI APIs,
tailored to the web. To the developer, it offers complete abstraction of
any web-specific implementation details, including event handling, graphics
support, graceful degradation (or progressive enhancement), and pretty URLs.

Unlike many page-based frameworks, Wt was designed for creating stateful
applications that are at the same time highly interactive (leveraging
techinques such as Ajax to their fullest) and accessible (supporting plain HTML
browsers), using automatic graceful degradation or progressive enhancement.

The library comes with an application server that acts as a stand-alone web
server or integrates through FastCGI with other web servers.

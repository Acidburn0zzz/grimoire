Although solutions exist for hosting Python web applications using Apache, they
are either slow, complicated to use, unreliable, or not suitable for commodity
web hosting.

The aim of mod_wsgi is to implement a simple to use Apache module which can host
any Python application which supports the Python WSGI interface. The module
would be suitable for use in hosting high performance production web sites, as
well as your average self managed personal sites running on web hosting services.

With a bit more work and encouragement, future versions of mod_wsgi will include
additional features which should help it to also break into the truly low cost
commodity web hosting market where Python is currently sadly lacking as an option.

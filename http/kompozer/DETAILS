KompoZer is a complete Web Authoring System that combines web file management
and easy-to-use WYSIWYG web page editing capabilities found in Microsoft
FrontPage, Adobe DreamWeaver and other high end programs.

KompoZer is designed to be extremely easy to use, making it ideal for
non-technical computer users who want to create an attractive,
professional-looking web site without needing to know HTML or web coding.

KompoZer is based on Gecko, the layout engine inside Mozilla; it's a
super-fast, very reliable, standards conformant engine maintained on a daily
basis by a wide community of developers. Its remarkable support of XML, CSS and
JavaScript offers the best authoring platform on the market. Its architecture
based on XUL makes it the most extensible editing tool ever.

KompoZer is a stand-alone tool; hence its small size and fast speed.

Those who are familiar with the DreamWeaver interface will feel right at home
with KompoZer:
  * WYSIWYG editing of pages, making web creation as easy as typing a letter
    with your word processor.
  * Integrated file management via FTP. Simply login to your web site and
    navigate through your files, editing web pages on the fly, directly from
    your site.

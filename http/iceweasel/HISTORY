	* PRE_BUILD, BUILD, INSTALL: Replaced commented-out lines with 'true'
	  as dictated by the spell deprecation procedure.
	* CONFIGURE: Deleted, not needed in a deprecated spell.
	* PROVIDES: Removed comment characters. Commenting out lines in
	  PROVIDES doesn't work because it's not a bash script; instead
	  provides.index will claim that the spell provides '#'. Letting a
	  deprecated spell keep its providers is probably the best thing to do
	  to avoid forcing an unwanted recompile upon users.
	* CONFLICTS: Added with 'conflicts iceweasel y' according to the spell
	  deprecation procedure.
	* EXPORTS, REPAIR^none^EXPORTS: Added, export variables for use in
	  icecat's CONFIGURE.

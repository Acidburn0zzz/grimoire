Apache 2.2 offers numerous enhancements, improvements and performance 
boosts over the 1.3 and 2.0 codebase. The most visible and noteworthy addition 
is the ability to run Apache in a hybrid thread/process mode on any 
platform that supports both threads and processes. This has shown to 
improve the scalability of the Apache HTTP Server significantly in our 
testing. Apache 2.2 also includes support for filtered I/O. This allows 
modules to modify the output of other modules before it is sent to the 
client. We have also included support for IPv6 on any platform that 
supports IPv6.

Apache is the world's most popular HTTP server, being quite possibly
the best around in terms of functionality, efficiency, security and
speed.

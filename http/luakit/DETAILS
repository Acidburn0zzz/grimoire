luakit is a highly configurable, micro-browser framework based on the WebKit
web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit.
It is very fast, extensible by Lua.
It is primarily targeted at power users, developers and any people with too
much time on their hands who want to have fine-grained control over their web
browsers behaviour and interface.

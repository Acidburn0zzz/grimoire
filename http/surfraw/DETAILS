cat << EOF
Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of popular
WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims google, altavista,
babelfish, dejanews, freshmeat, research index, slashdot and many others from
the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen lands of html-forms, placing these
wonders where they belong, deep in unix heartland, as god loving extensions
to the shell.

Surfraw abstracts the browser away from input. Doing so lets it get on with
what it's good at. Browsing. Interpretation of linguistic forms is handed
back to the shell, which is what it, and human beings are good at. Combined
with netscape-remote or incremental text browsers, such as lynx, links or
w3m, along with screen a Surfraw liberateur is capable of navigating speeds
that leave GUI tainted idolaters agape with fear and wonder.

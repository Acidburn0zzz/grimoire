The uWSGI project aims at developing a full stack for building hosting
services.

Application servers (for various programming languages and protocols),
proxies, process managers and monitors are all implemented using a common
api and a common configuration style.

Thanks to its pluggable architecture it can be extended to support more
platforms and languages.

Currently, you can write plugins in C, C++ and Objective-C.

The “WSGI” part in the name is a tribute to the namesake Python standard,
as it has been the first developed plugin for the project.

Versatility, performance, low-resource usage and reliability are the strengths
of the project (and the only rules followed).

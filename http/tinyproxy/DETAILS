Tinyproxy is a fast light-weight HTTP proxy for POSIX operating systems,
released under the GNU GPL license. Designed from the ground up to be fast and
yet small, it is an ideal solution for use cases such as embedded deployments
where a full featured HTTP proxy is required, but the system resources for a
larger proxy are unavailable.

Tinyproxy is fully compatible with popular web browsers and has a number of
useful features.

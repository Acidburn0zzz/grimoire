cat << EOF
â€¦a keyboard controlled (modal vim-like bindings, or with modifier keys)
browser based on Webkit.

Very minimal interface. No unnecessary interface elements, controllable
through a FIFO and with external scripts.

What is not browsing, is not in uzbl. Things like url changing,
loading/saving of bookmarks, saving history,.. are handled through
external scripts that you write

Uzbl keeps it simple, and puts you in charge.

Uzbl follows the UNIX philosophy - "Write programs that do one thing
and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to
handle text streams, because that is a universal interface."

Uzbl is under heavy development at the moment and shouldn't really be
used as your main browser. Unless you're daring of course. The latest
'stable' branch is located in Dieterbe's master branch, and the latest
development version in his experimental branch. You can, however, run
code from the other developers branches, it just might not work.

Siege is an http load testing and benchmarking utility. It was designed to let
web developers measure their code under duress, to see how it will stand up to
load on the internet. Siege supports basic authentication, cookies, HTTP and
HTTPS protocols. It lets its user hit a web server with a configurable number
of simulated web browsers. Those browsers place the server "under siege".

Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It supports
ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port scanning techniques
(determine what services the hosts are offering), and TCP/IP fingerprinting
(remote host operating system identification). Nmap also offers flexible
target and port specification, decoy scanning, determination of TCP sequence
predictability characteristics, sunRPC scanning, reverse-identd scanning,
and more. Console and X-Window versions are available.

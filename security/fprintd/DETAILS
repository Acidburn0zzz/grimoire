cat << EOF
fprintd is a D-Bus daemon that offers libfprint functionality over the
D-Bus interprocess communication bus. By adding this daemon layer above
libfprint,
we solve various problems related to multiple applications simulatenously
competing for fingerprint readers.
While it is not very nice to think of a daemon being necessary in this
scenario,
fprintd will be launched by D-Bus through the activation mechanism.
This means it is launched only when needed, and additionally it will shut
itself down after a period of inactivity.

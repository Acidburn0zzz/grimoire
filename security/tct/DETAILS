TCT is a collection of programs by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema for a
post-mortem analysis of a UNIX system after break-in.
The programs are all either oriented towards gathering or analyzing
forensic data on a Unix system.  There is no single task or ultimate
goal that they are directed to, but if there was a theme it'd be an
effort towards the reconstruction of the past - determining as much
as possible what happened with a static snapshot of a system.  Most of
the tools are oriented towards data collection rather than analysis -
a good use of the toolkit could be for a relative neophyte in Unix
forensic security to send the data to someone who does know something and
can further analyze the output.

Examples of using TCT can be found in the Forensic Discovery book.

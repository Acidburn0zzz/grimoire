cat << EOF
fwknop stands for the "FireWall KNock OPerator", and implements an
authorization scheme called Single Packet Authorization (SPA) that is
based around iptables and libpcap. SPA requires only a single encrypted
packet in order to communicate various pieces of information including
desired access through an iptables policy and/or complete commands to
execute on the target system. By using iptables to maintain a "default
drop" stance, the main application of this program is to protect services
such as OpenSSH with an additional layer of security in order to make the
exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much more
difficult. With fwknop deployed, anyone using nmap to look for sshd can't
even tell that it is listening; it makes no difference if they have a
0-day exploit or not.

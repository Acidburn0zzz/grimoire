cat << EOF
ssdeep is a program for computing context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH).
Also called fuzzy hashes, CTPH can match inputs that have homologies. Such
inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes
in between these sequences may be different in both content and length.

zzuf is a transparent application input fuzzer. Its purpose is to find
bugs in applications by corrupting their user-contributed data (which
more than often comes from untrusted sources on the Internet). It works
by intercepting file and network operations and changing random bits in
the program’s input. zzuf’s behaviour is deterministic, making it
easier to reproduce bugs.

cat << EOF
This is RATS, a rough auditing tool for security, developed by Secure
Software Inc.  It is a tool for scanning C, C++, Perl, PHP, Python
and Ruby source code and flagging common security related programming
errors such as buffer overflows and TOCTOU (Time Of Check, Time Of
Use) race conditions.  As its name implies, the tool performs only a
rough analysis of source code.  It will not find every error and will
also find things that are not errors.  Manual inspection of your code
is still necessary, but greatly aided with this tool.

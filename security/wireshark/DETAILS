Wireshark is a successor to Ethereal.
Wireshark is a free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. 
It allows you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file
on disk.  You  can interactively browse the capture data, viewing
summary and detail information for each packet.  Wireshark has several
powerful features, including a rich display filter language and the
ability to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.

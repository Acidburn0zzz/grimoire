Wireshark is a successor to Ethereal. Wireshark is a free network protocol
analyzer for Unix and Windows. It allows you to examine data from a live network
or from a capture file on disk.  You  can interactively browse the capture data,
viewing summary and detail information for each packet.  Wireshark has several
powerful features, including a rich display filter language and the ability to
view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.

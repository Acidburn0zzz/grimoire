Ninja is a privilege escalation detection and prevention system for GNU/Linux
hosts. While running, it will monitor process activity on the local host, and
keep track of all processes running as root.  If a process is spawned with UID
or GID zero (root), ninja will log necessary informa- tion about this process,
and optionally kill the process if it was spawned by an unauthorized user.

A "magic" group can be specified, allowing members of this group to run any
setuid/setgid root executable.

Individual executables can be whitelisted.  Ninja uses a fine grained whitelist
that lets you whitelist executables on a group and/or user basis. This can
be used to allow specific groups or individual users access to setuid/set-
gid root programs, such as su and passwd.

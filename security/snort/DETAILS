Snort is a lightweight network intrusion detection system, capable of 
performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP
networks. It can perform protocol analysis, content
searching/matching and can be used to detect a variety of attacks and 
probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks,
SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more. Snort uses a
flexible rule based language to describe traffic that it should
collect or pass, and a modular detection engine. Snort has a
real-time alerting capability, with alert mechanisms for syslog, a
user specified file, a UNIX socket, or WinPopup messages to Windows
clients using Samba's smbclient.

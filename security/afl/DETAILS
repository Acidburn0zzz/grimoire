American fuzzy lop is a security-oriented fuzzer that employs a novel type of
compile-time instrumentation and genetic algorithms to automatically discover
clean, interesting test cases that trigger new internal states in the targeted
binary. This substantially improves the functional coverage for the fuzzed
code. The compact synthesized corpora produced by the tool are also useful for
seeding other, more labor- or resource-intensive testing regimes down the road.

Compared to other instrumented fuzzers, afl-fuzz is designed to be practical:
it has modest performance overhead, uses a variety of highly effective
fuzzing strategies and effort minimization tricks, requires essentially no
configuration, and seamlessly handles complex, real-world use cases --- say,
common image parsing or file compression libraries.

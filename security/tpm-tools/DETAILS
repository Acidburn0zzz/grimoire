tpm-tools is an open-source package designed to enable user and application
enablement of Trusted Computing using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM),
similar to a smart card environment.  Trusted Computing is a set of
specifications set forth by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG).  For more
information on the TCG and Trusted Computing please visit the Trusted
Computing Group website at:

http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org.

The tpm-tools package contains commands to allow the platform administrator
the ability to manage and diagnose the platform's TPM.  Additionally, the
package contains commands to utilize some of the capabilities available
in the TPM PKCS#11 interface implemented in the openCryptoki project.

cat << EOF
The main goals were to provide system call auditing with 1) as low
overhead as possible, and 2) without duplicating functionality that is
already provided by SELinux (and/or other security infrastructures).
This framework will work "stand-alone", but is not designed to provide,
e.g., CAPP functionality without another security component in place.

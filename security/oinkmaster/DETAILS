cat << EOF
Oinkmaster is simple Perl script to help you update/manage your Snort 2.0+
rules
and comment out the unwanted ones after each update (among other things). It
will
tell you exactly what had changed since the last update, hence giving you good
control of your rules.
Oinkmaster can be used to manage the official rules from www.snort.org, but can
just as well be used for managing your homemade rules and distribute them
between
sensors.
It may be useful in concuntion with any program that can use Snort rules, like
Snort (doh!) or Prelude-NIDS. It will run on most UNIX systems and also
on Windows.

cat << EOF
This project allows a server to run silently, invisibly, with all TCP ports
closed... except to those who know... the secret knock!

The doorman is intended to run on systems which have their firewall rules
turned down tightly enough as to be effectively invisible to the outside world.

The doorman adds and removes extra rules in a carefully controlled manner.

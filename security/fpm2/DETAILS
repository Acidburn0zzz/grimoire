FPM2 is GTK2 port from Figaro's Password Manager originally developed by John
Conneely, with some new enhancements.

Features:
- Passwords are encrypted with the AES-256 (old version use blowfish) algorithm.
- Key for encryption is generated with PBKDF2 using HMAC-SHA-256 with 8192
  iterations.
- Optionally you can use two-factor authentication. For decrypt list of
  passwords you must know master password and you must have key file.
- Copy passwords or usernames to the clipboard/primary selection.
- If the password is for a web site, FPM2 can keep track of the URLs of your
  login screens and can automatically launch your browser. In this capacity,
  FPM2 acts as a kind of bookmark manager.
- Combine all three features: you can configure FPM2 to bring you to a web login
  screen, copy your username to the clipboard and your password to the primary
  selection, all with a single button click.
- FPM2 also has a password generator that can choose passwords for you. It
  allows you to determine how long the password should be, and what types of
  characters (lower case, upper case, numbers and symbols) should be used. You
  can even have it avoid ambiguous characters such as a capital O or the number
  zero.
- You can teach FPM2 to launch other applications, and optionally pass
  hostnames, usernames or passwords to the command line.
- Passwords can be organized in various category and may have detailed notes.
- With "search as you type" function you easily find what you want.
- Auto-minimise and/or auto-locking passwords database after configurable time
  to the tray icon.

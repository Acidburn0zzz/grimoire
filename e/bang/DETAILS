cat << EOF
Bang is module that do composite using OpenGL... this means that finally we can
have 3D desktop effects in enlightenment!!

The code is based on the original work of Ibukun Olumuyiwa that first port
compiz to e.

There is also the scale plugin (automatically loaded) that do the famous expos?
effect ... yes it works :)    For now you can only activate / disactivate it
from keyb (can't select the window with the mouse). First I want to fix well
the core.

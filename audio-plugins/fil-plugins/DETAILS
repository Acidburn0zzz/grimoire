cat << EOF
There's one plugin in this first release, a four-band parametric equaliser. 
Each section has an active/bypass switch, frequency, bandwidth and gain 
controls. There is also a global bypass switch and gain control.

The 2nd order resonant filters are implemented using a Mitra-Regalia style 
lattice filter, which has the nice property of being stable even while 
parameters are being changed.

All switches and controls are internally smoothed, so they can be used 'live' 
whithout any clicks or zipper noises. This should make this plugin a good 
candidate for use in systems that allow automation of plugin control ports, 
such as Ardour, or for stage use.

BLOP comprises a set of LADSPA  plugins that generate bandlimited 
sawtooth, square, variable pulse and slope-variable triangle waves, for 
use in LADSPA hosts, principally for use with one of the many modular 
software synthesisers available.

They are wavetable based, and are designed to produce output with 
harmonic content as high as possible over a wide pitch range.

Additionally, there are a few extra plugins to assist in building 
synthesis networks. Full details can be found in the List-o-Plugins

BLOP comprises a set of LADSPA  plugins that generate bandlimited sawtooth,
square, variable pulse and slope-variable triangle waves, for use in LADSPA
hosts, principally for use with one of the many modular software synthesisers
available.

They are wavetable based, and are designed to produce output with harmonic
content as high as possible over a wide pitch range. Additionally, there
are a few extra plugins to assist in building synthesis networks.

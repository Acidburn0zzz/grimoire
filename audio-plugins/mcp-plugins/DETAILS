mvclpf24.so
 * This plugin contains four versions of a digital implementation of the 
   voltage controlled lowpass filter designed by Robert A. Moog.

mvchpf24.so
 * This is a highpass filter, again based on a classic design by Robert Moog.

cs_phaser.so
 * phaser1 is similar to the CSound module 'phaser1'. Phaser1+LFO is the same 
   thing, but the external modulation has been replaced by a built-in LFO.

cs_chorus.so
 * These two plugins are based on a CSound orchestra file by Sean Costello. 
   There are two low frequency oscillators, each having three outputs that are 
   120 degrees apart in phase.

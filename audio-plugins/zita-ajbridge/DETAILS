Zita-ajbridge provides two applications, zita-a2j and zita-j2a. They allow
to use an ALSA device as a Jack client, to provide additional capture (a2j)
or playback (j2a) channels. Functionally these are equivalent to the alsa_in
and alsa_out clients that come with Jack, but they provide much better
audio quality. The resampling ratio will typically be stable within 1 PPM
and change only very smoothly. Delay will be stable as well even under worse
case conditions, e.g. the Jack client running near the end of the cycle.

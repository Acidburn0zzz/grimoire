XMMS mp3cue adds cue file support to XMMS.

Cue files store information (Artist, Title, Time) describing smaller tracks
within a large audio file.
mp3cue allows you to easily manipulate these cue files; and more importantly,
it presents you with a separate playlist composed from the cue information
which you can use to easily navigate to any of the smaller tracks in the audio
file, just like a normal playlist. You can also save this cue information
within an ID3v2 tag (if the audio file is an mp3), eliminating the need for
an external cue file.

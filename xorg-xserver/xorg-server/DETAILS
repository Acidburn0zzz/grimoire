X servers (including Xorg, Xprt, Xvfb, Xnest & Xdmx), the core of the X
Window System.

The X server accepts requests from client applications to create windows,
which are (normally rectangular) "virtual screens" that the client program
can draw into.

Windows are then composed on the actual screen by the X server
(or by a separate composite manager) as directed by the window manager,
which usually communicates with the user via graphical controls such as buttons
and draggable titlebars and borders.

MComix is an user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically
designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer. It reads
images in ZIP, RAR, 7Zip or tar archives as well as plain image files. It
is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings, and runs on
both Linux and Windows.

MComix is a fork of the Comix project, and aims to add bug fixes and stability
improvements after Comix development came to a halt in late 2009.

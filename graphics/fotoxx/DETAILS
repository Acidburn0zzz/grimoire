Fotoxx is a program for improving digital photos.  Navigate through
large image directories using a window of thumbnail images. Create HDR
(high dynamic range) images by combining bright and dark images to improve
details visible in both bright and dark areas. Create panorama (extra wide)
images by joining overlapped images. Adjust brightness and color intensity
independently for different underlying brightness levels. Reduce fog or haze
by removing "whiteness" and intensifying colors. Rotate an image
(level a tilted image or turn 90 degrees). Remove the red-eye effect from
electronic flash photos. Resize or crop an image.

Psiconv is a file conversion utility that converts between Psion
5(MX) files and more commonly-used Linux file formats. It can read
Psion Word, TextEd, Sketch, MBM, and Clipart files, and outputs HTML
3.2, HTML 4, ASCII, and almost any graphical format. The libpsiconv
library can also read Sheet files and output Word and TextEd files
for use in other programs. Included is full documentation on several
Psion 5(MX) file formats. This information is not available from
Psion (it has been reverse-engineered from Psion files), and it's
free for anybody to use.

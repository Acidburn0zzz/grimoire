DjVu is a web-centric format and software platform for distributing documents
and images.
DjVuLibre is an open source (GPL'ed) implementation of DjVu, including viewers,
browser plugins, decoders, simple encoders, and utilities.
DjVu can advantageously replace PDF, PS, TIFF, JPEG, and GIF for distributing
scanned documents, digital documents, or high-resolution pictures.
DjVu content downloads faster, displays and renders faster, looks nicer on
a screen, and consume less client resources than competing formats. DjVu
images display instantly and can be smoothly zoomed and panned with no
lengthy re-rendering.
DjVu is used by hundreds of academic, commercial, governmental, and
non-commercial web sites around the world.

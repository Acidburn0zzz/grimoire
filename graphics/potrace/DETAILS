potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap
into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP
format), and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript file (EPS). A
typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such as company or
university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image is not "jaggy"
like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.

potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS, PostScript,
SVG (scalable vector graphics), and PGM (for easy antialiasing). Additional
backends might be added in the future.

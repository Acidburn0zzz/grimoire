The files coming out of a pretty much all Digital cameras are in the Exif
flavour of Jpeg files. Exif files are for the most part Jpeg files, but
start with a different header block, and contain additional data sections
with camera settings, as well as a preview thumbnail picture as part of the
Exif header. Most editing / viewing software just skips past the Exif header
and ignores it outright, so you normally don't notice its even there.

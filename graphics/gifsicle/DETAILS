Gifsicle is a powerful command-line program for manipulating GIF image
files. It has good support for transparency and colormap manipulation, simple
image transformations (cropping, flipping), and creating, deconstructing, and
editing GIF animations. It can also optimize GIF animations for space. Also
included is a GIF animation viewer and a program that checks whether two
GIFs look the same.

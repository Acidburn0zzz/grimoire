About fbida

The fbida project contains a few applications for viewing and editing images,
with the main focus being photos. The applications are:

fbi
    This is a image viewer for the linux framebuffer console.
fbgs
    A wrapper script for viewing ps/pdf files on the framebuffer console
    using fbi.
ida
    This is a X11 application (Motif based) for viewing images. Some basic
    editing functions are available too.
exiftran
    command line tool to do lossless transformations of JPEG images. Works
    much like jpegtran, but unlike jpegtran it does not ignore the EXIF data ;)
thumbnail.cgi
    Small and fast CGI script (written in C) to extract EXIF thumbnails from
    jpeg images and send them to the web browser.

KeyJnote is a program that displays presentation slides. But unlike
OpenOffice.org Impress or other similar applications, it does so with
style. Smooth alpha-blended slide transitions are provided for the sake of
eye candy, but in addition to this, KeyJnote offers some unique tools that
are really useful for presentations. Read below if you want to know more
about these features.

Creating presentations for KeyJnote is very simple: You just need to export
a PDF file from your presentation software. This means that you can create
slides in the application of your choice and use KeyJnote for displaying
them. If your application does not support PDF output, you can alternatively
use a set of pre-rendered image files or you use KeyJnote to make a slideshow
with your favorite photos.

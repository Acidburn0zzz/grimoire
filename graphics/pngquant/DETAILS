cat << EOF
pngquant is a command-line utility for converting 24/32-bit PNG images to
paletted (8-bit) PNGs.

The conversion reduces file sizes significantly (often as much as 70%) and
preserves full alpha transparency. Generated images are compatible with all
modern web browsers, and have better fallback in IE6 than 24-bit PNGs.

Features:
 * High-quality palette generation using modernized Median Cut algorithm.
 * Unique dithering algorithm that adds less noise to images than the standard
   Floyd-Steinberg.
 * Easy to integrate with shell scripts, GUIs and server-side software.
 * Fast mode for processing large numbers of images.

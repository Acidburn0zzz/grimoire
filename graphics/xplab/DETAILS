XPLAB tries to recognize patterns in a scanned document image by trained
templates stored in a database. The user can switch easily between all
phases in the same run. The main phases are training, recognition and
maintenance. Some effort is made to simplify the training phase, which is
the most time consuming part of interactivity.  XPLAB provides a so-called
batch-mode. That means, XPLAB can be run without any GUI. The batch-mode is
usable for the phases of recognition, clustering and RB chaining, respectively.

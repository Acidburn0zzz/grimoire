cat << EOF
TopMod is based on a new paradigm that allows dynamically changing the
topology of 2-manifold polygonal meshes. The new paradigm always guarantees
topological consistency of polygonal meshes.

Based on our paradigm, by simply adding and deleting edges,handles can be
created and deleted, holes can be opened or closed, polygonal meshes can be
connected or disconnected. These edge insertion and edge deletion operations
are highly consistent with subdivision algorithms. In particular, these
operations can easily be included into a subdivision modeling system such
that the topological changes and subdivision operations can be performed
alternatively during model construction.

TopMod demonstrates practical examples of topology changes based on this new
paradigm and show that the new paradigm is convenient, effective, efficient,
and friendly to subdivision surfaces.

GIMP Liquid rescale plugin is a free, open source frontend to the Liquid
Rescale Library, which provides an implementation of the Seam Carving
algorithm as described in the paper "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image
Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir, which can be found at
http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf. The Seam Carving procedure
aims at resizing pictures non uniformly while preserving their features,
i.e. avoiding distortion of the important parts.

The plugin supports manual feature selection, and can also be used to remove
portions of the picture in a consistent way. Since version 0.6 it also 
supports real-time interactive scaling.

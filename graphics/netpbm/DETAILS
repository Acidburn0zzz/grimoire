NetPBM (formerly PBMplus) is a package of over 220 programs that convert
from one graphics format to another and do simple editing and analysis
of images. There are no interactive tools in this package, and nothing
that displays graphics of any kind. Over 80 graphics formats are
handled, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, XWD, XBM, G3 fax, and
special formats used by digital cameras and handheld computers. Over 40
editing functions include scaling, cropping, quantization and dithering,
colorizing and uncolorizing, blurring, and dimming. Netpbm programs are
often invoked by other programs, for example in CGI scripts that manage
web site graphics. It also includes a C function library which helps you
write programs to process graphics at a lower level than the Netpbm
utilities.

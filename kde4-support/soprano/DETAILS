cat << EOF
Soprano (formally known as QRDF) is a library which provides a nice Qt
interface to RDF storage solutions. It has a modular structure which
allows to  replace the actual RDF storage implementation used.

Soprano has the following features:

* Full context (i.e. named graph) support
* Plugin structure for extensibility.
* Backend plugins for:
  - Redland
  - Sesame2
  - Virtuoso
* Parser and serializer plugins for:
  - raptor (rdf+xml, turtle, trig, nTriples)
  - nQuads
* A server and client lib which allows a simple remote
  Soprano server.
* SPARQL http enpoint support
* Simple sopranod server application.
* Simple command line tool to perform commands on models in
  a Soprano server (sopranocmd)
* Rule-based Forward inference engine.
* Full-text index based on CLucene which indexes all literal
  statements (i.e. those statements with a literal object node)
* Hierarchical architecture which allows to stack multiple filter models
  on top of an RDF storage.

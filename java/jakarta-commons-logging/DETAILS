cat << EOF
There is a great need for debugging and logging information inside of
Commons components
such as HTTPClient and DBCP. However, there are many logging APIs out there
and it is
difficult to choose among them.

The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging
libraries. Commons
components may use the Logging API to remove compile-time and run-time
dependencies on
any particular logging package, and contributors may write Log implementations
for the
library of their choice.

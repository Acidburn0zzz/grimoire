Sawfish is an extensible window manager using a Lisp-based scripting 
language --all window decorations are configurable and all user-interface 
policy is controlled through the extension language. This is no layer 
on top of twm, but a wholly new architecture.

Despite this extensibility its policy is very minimal compared to most 
window managers. Its aim is simply to manage windows in the most
flexible and attractive manner possible. As such it does not implement
desktop backgrounds, applications docks, or other things that may be achieved 
through separate applications.

This is the GTK+/GNOME 2.0 version of sawfish

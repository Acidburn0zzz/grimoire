PolicyKit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes: It is a 
framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to granting
access to privileged operations for unprivileged applications. PolicyKit is 
specifically targeting applications in rich desktop environments on multi-user 
UNIX-like operating systems. It does not imply or rely on any exotic kernel 
features.

gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the i/o
abstractions of gio (a library availible in glib >= 2.15.1). It installs several
modules that are automatically used by applications using the APIs of libgio.
There is also fuse support that allows applications not using gio to access the
gvfs filesystems.

The gvfs model differs from e.g. gnome-vfs in that filesystems must be mounted
before they are used. There is a central daemon (gvfsd) that handles coordinting
mounts, and then each mount is (typically) in its own daemon process (although
mounts can share daemon process).

gvfs comes with a set of backends, including trash support, sftp, smb, http, dav
and others. More backends are planned.

gvfs also contains modules for gio that implement hal volume monitors and the
gnome uri-scheme handler configuration.

There is a set of command line programs starting with "gvfs-" that lets you run
commands (like cat, ls, stat, etc) on files in the gvfs mounts.

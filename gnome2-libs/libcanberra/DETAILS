cat << EOF
libcanberra is an implementation of the XDG Sound Theme and Name Specifications,
for generating event sounds on free desktops, such as GNOME. It comes with 
several backends (ALSA, PulseAudio, OSS, GStreamer, null) and is designed to be 
portable. It consists of the following parts:

   1. libcanberra: the main library
   2. libcanberra-gtk: some glue code to make it easier to use libcanberra from 
      Gtk+ applications
   3. libcanberra-gtk-module: a Gtk+ module that uses libcanberra-gtk to trigger 
      input feedback event sounds

Clutter is an open source software library for creating fast, visually rich
and animated graphical user interfaces.

Clutter uses OpenGL (and optionally OpenGL ES) for rendering but with an
API which hides the underlying GL complexity from the developer. The Clutter
API is intended to be easy to use, efficient and flexible.

Clutter currently features the following:

    * Object oriented design via GObject with a familiar GTK+ like API.
    * Scene-graph of interface elements with multiple layers, positioning in 3D
      space, grouping, transparency, scaling, clipping and rotation.
    * Input event handling.  * Frame based animation engine providing path
    interpolation, transitions
      and other custom effects via Behaviours and Timelines.
    * Custom Pango renderer providing efficient internationalized text
    rendering.  * Support for media playback with GStreamer, Cairo graphics
    rendering and GTK+
      embedding are available via optional add-on libraries.
    * Language bindings for Perl, Python and Mono * Backend windowing system
    support via GLX, SDL and EGL

Clutter is free software released under the GNU LGPL

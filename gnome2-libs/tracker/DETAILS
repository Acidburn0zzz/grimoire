Tracker is a powerful desktop-neutral first class object database, tag/metadata
database, search tool and indexer.

Tracker is also extremely fast and super efficient with your systems memory when
compared with some other competing frameworks

It consists of a common object database that allows entities to have an almost 
infinte number of properties, metadata (both embedded/harvested as well as user 
definable), a comprehensive database of keywords/tags and links to other 
entities.

It provides additional features for file based objects including context linking 
and audit trails for a file object.

It has the ability to index, store, harvest metadata. retrieve and search all 
types of files and other first class objects.

First class object support includes : Files, Documents, Music, Images, Videos, 
Playlists*, Notes*, Applications*, Contacts*, Emails*, Conversations*, 
Appointments*, Tasks*, Bookmarks*, History* and Projects*

(* these services are not currently indexed at the moment but will be in later 
versions)

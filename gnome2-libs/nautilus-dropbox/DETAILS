Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring all your photos, docs, and videos
anywhere. This means that any file you save to your Dropbox will automatically
save to all your computers, phones and even the Dropbox website. Dropbox also
makes it super easy to share with others, whether you're a student or
professional, parent or grandparent. Even if you accidentally spill a latte on
your laptop, have no fear! You can relax knowing that Dropbox always has you
covered, and none of your stuff will ever be lost.

porg (formerly known as paco), is a program to aid management of software
packages installed from source code.

After the installation of such packages, one is usually left with having no
idea of what it was installed and where it all went, making it difficult to
uninstall the package in the future. Porg was written to solve this problem
in a quite simple fashion.

When installing a package from sources, porg wraps the install command
(e.g. "make install"), and saves installation information into a text database.

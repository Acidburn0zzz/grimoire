Star is a very fast tar-like tape archiver with improved functionality.
Star archives and extracts multiple files to and from a single file
called a tarfile. A tarfile is usually a magnetic tape, but it can be
any file. In all cases, appearance of a directory name refers to the
files and (recursively) sub-directories of that directory.

Star was first created in 1982 to extract tapes on a UNIX clone that
had no tar command. In 1985 the first fully functional version has been
released as mtar.

When the old star format extensions have been introduced in 1985, it
was renamed to star (Schily tar). In 1994, Posix 1003.1-1988 extensions
were added and star was renamed to star (Standard tar).

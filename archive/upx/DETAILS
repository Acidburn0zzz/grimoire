    UPX is a versatile executable packer with the following features:

        * excellent compression ratio: typically compresses better than
        WinZip/zip/gzip, use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution !

        * very fast decompression: ~10 MB/sec on an ancient Pentium 133,
        ~200 MB/sec on an Athlon XP 2000+.

        * no memory overhead for your compressed executables because of
        in-place decompression.

        * safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables. Also, a
        checksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is maintained
        internally.
        * universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats:
              o atari/tos
              o djgpp2/coff
              o dos/com
              o dos/exe
              o dos/sys
              o linux/386
              o rtm32/pe
              o tmt/adam
              o watcom/le (supporting DOS4G, PMODE/W, DOS32a and CauseWay)
              o win32/pe

        * portable: UPX is written in portable endian-neutral C++

        * extendable: because of the class layout it's very easy to add new
        executable formats or new compression algorithms

        * free: UPX is distributed with full source code under the GNU General
        Public License, and may be used freely even with commercial programs.

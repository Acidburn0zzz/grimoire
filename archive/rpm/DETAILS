The RPM Package Manager (RPM) is a powerful command line driven package
management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying, querying,
and updating computer software packages. Each software package consists of an
archive of files along with information about the package like its version, a
description, and the like. There is also a related API ("Application Program
Interface"), permitting advanced developers to bypass 'shelling out' to a
command line, and to manage such transactions from within a native coding
language.

EPM is an open source UNIX software and file packaging program that generates
distribution archives from a list of files. EPM provides a complete,
cross-platform software distribution solution for your applications.

EPM generates both native and "portable" script-based distribution packages
complete with installation and removal scripts and standard install/uninstall
GUIs. The installers can be customized with product logos, "readme" files, and
click-wrap licenses as desired.

    Creates software packages that can be distributed on disc or over the
    Internet!  Supports AIX, Debian GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, HP-UX, IRIX, OS X,
    NetBSD, OpenBSD, Red Hat Linux, Slackware Linux, Solaris, and Tru64 UNIX.
    Provided as free software under the GNU General Public license.

The EPM book teaches you how to create your own software packages that can be
distributed over the Internet and on disc.

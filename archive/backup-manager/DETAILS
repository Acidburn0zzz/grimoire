Backup Manager is a tool for generating archives easily.  It is designed for
those who don't want an obfuscated tool for backing up their system. It can
make tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2, and zip archives, can perform incremental backups,
and can upload archives to remote hosts with FTP, SSH, or RSYNC. It can be
run in a parallel mode with different configuration files. The configuration
file is simple to understand. The backup process can also be customized
thanks to hook scripts.

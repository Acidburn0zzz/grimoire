       	Firebird 2 includes ODS changes, intended to improve database performance.
        These improvements are only available in databases using the new ODS.
        So, before uninstalling a previous Firebird version, make a backup using gbak.
        Then, after installation, use the new gbak to recreate your database which will
        then have the new ODS.
        
        There are major changes regarding the security database in this new version.
        Please make a copy of the existing security database /usr/firebird/security.fdb
        before casting this spell.
        Then, after installing firebird2, read the instructions in
        /usr/firebird/upgrade/security_database.txt

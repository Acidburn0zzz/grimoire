Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a
data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and
sorted sets.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set intersection,
union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted
set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an in-memory
dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the
dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very fast
non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split and so forth.

Other features include a simple check-and-set mechanism, pub/sub and
configuration settings to make Redis behave like a cache.

Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database
is a simple
data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value. Every
key and value is
serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and character string
can be used as a
key and a value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is neither
concept of
data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.
Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one million
records is 0.9
seconds for hash database, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree database. Moreover,
the size of
database is very small. For example, overhead for a record is 16 bytes for
hash database,
and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore, scalability of Kyoto Cabinet
is great. The
database size can be up to 8EB (9.22e18 bytes).

Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database is a simple 
data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value. Every key and value is 
serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and character string can be used as a 
key and a value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is neither concept of 
data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.
Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one million records is 0.9 
seconds for hash database, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree database. Moreover, the size of 
database is very small. For example, overhead for a record is 16 bytes for hash database, 
and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore, scalability of Kyoto Cabinet is great. The 
database size can be up to 8EB (9.22e18 bytes).

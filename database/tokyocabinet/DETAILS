Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database is 
a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value. 
Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary data and 
character string can be used as a key and a value. There is neither concept of 
data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.

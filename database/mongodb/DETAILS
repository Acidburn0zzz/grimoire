MongoDB bridges the gap between key-value stores (which are fast and highly
scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which provide rich queries and deep
functionality).

MongoDB (from "humongous") is a scalable, high-performance, open source,
document-oriented database. Written in C++, MongoDB features:

* Document-oriented storage: JSON-style documents with dynamic schemas offer
  simplicity and power.
* Full Index Support: index on any attribute, just like you're used to.
* Replication & High Availability: mirror across LANs and WANs for scale and
  peace of mind.
* Auto-Sharding: scale horizontally without compromising functionality.
* Querying: rich, document-based queries.
* Fast In-Place Updates: atomic modifiers for contention-free performance.
* Map/Reduce: flexible aggregation and data processing.
* GridFS: store files of any size without complicating your stack.

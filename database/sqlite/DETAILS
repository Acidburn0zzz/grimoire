SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large subset of
SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a single disk file. The
API is designed for convenience and ease of use. Applications that link against
SQLite can enjoy the power and flexiblity of an SQL database without the
administrative hassles of supporting a separate database server. Because it
omits the client-server interaction overhead and writes directly to disk,
SQLite is also faster than the big database servers for most operations. In
addition to the C library, the SQLite distribution includes a command-line tool
for interacting with SQLite databases and SQLite bindings for Tcl/Tk.

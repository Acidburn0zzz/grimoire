cat << EOF
This library provides a single main WebServer class which works with a
framework to support the use of loadable bundles to handle requests
on particular URLs.
The main of the library is to make it easy for you to write programs
which can act as web servers (eg. and XMLRPC server) or simply provide
a web-based user interface so that your application can be controlled
from a web browser.
Incoming requests may by handled by a delegate, or passed to a bundle
loaded at runtime on the basis of the URL requested.
Convenience methods are provided to vend static pages or vend template
pages where values provided by your code are inserted into the templates.

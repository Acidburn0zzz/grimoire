This library is a collection of classes intended to be used to help
improve the performance of GNUstep and Cocoa applications.  The scope
of the library is therefore -
1. Subclasses of standard Cocoa classes which are optimised for particular
uses.
2. Classes to perform tasks which can improve application performance
by mechanisms not covered by existing classes.
3. Classes to monitor/analyse performance issues so you can tell what
needs to be optimised.

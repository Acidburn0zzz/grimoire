ffmpeg-php is an extension for PHP that adds an easy to use, object-oriented
API for accessing and retrieving information from video and audio files.
It has methods for returning frames from movie files as images that can be
manipulated using PHP's image functions.  This works well for automatically
creating thumbnail images from movies.  ffmpeg-php is also useful for reporting
the duration and bitrate of audio files (mp3, wma, etc).  ffmpeg-php can
access many of the video formats supported by ffmpeg (mov, avi, mpg, wmv, etc).

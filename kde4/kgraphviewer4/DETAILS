KGraphViewer is a GraphViz dot graph viewer for KDE. The graphviz dot 
program
 is a free software layout engine for graphs. They are commonly used in
 scientific domains and particularly in computer science. But until now 
there
 was a lack of GUI to look at the graphs. Programs given with GraphViz 
are out
 of date X11 or Tcl/Tk ones with few functionalities.

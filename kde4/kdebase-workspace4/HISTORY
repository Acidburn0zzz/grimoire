	* kde4.desktop: refer to correct file
	* kde4.sh: added
	* PRE_BUILD: added, to create kde4 group
	* INSTALL: install kde4.sh
	  it is now possible to start a kde4 session and have a working desktop
	  beware that if kde3 is also installed, kde4 will take precedence!!!
	  by default, only users who belong to group kde4 can use this
	  they will also have a separate desktop configuration for kde3/4
	  this is controlled by the variable KDEHOME
	  reset KDEHOME to share the same desktop in kde3/4
	  you will then get a mixture of kde3/4 applications

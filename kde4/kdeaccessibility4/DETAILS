The kdeaccessibility package contains three KDE Accessibility Aids:
KMouseTool, KMag and KMouth.

KMouseTool is a Linux-based KDE program. It clicks the mouse for you, so
you don't have to. KMouseTool works with any mouse or pointing device.

KMagnifier (or kmag, its unix name) is a small utility for Linux to magnify
a part of the screen. It magnifies the area of the screen around the mouse
pointer or optionally a user defined area. Additionally it offers to save a
magnified screenshot to disk.

KMouth is a KDE program which enables persons that cannot speak to let
their computer speak, e.g. mutal people or people who have lost their
voice. It has a text input field and speaks the sentences that you enter.
It also has support for user defined phrasebooks.

1. all the code in this section is very experimental.
   however, it has compiled for me.

2. the dependencies of the spells are very much in a state of flux.

3. some new dependencies will require several new spells
   e.g. decibel -> tapioca-qt  -> tapioca
   some of these are only available from svn

4. still not clear what is optional and what is required

5. need proper xorg-modular support (most of this was copied from kde3 spells)

6. need sub-depends support

7. we need to check that our CFLAGS are being used correctly.

8. need to check startup scripts (kdm4?), session manager?
   coexistence with kde3?

9. must setup session bus (dbus) correctly

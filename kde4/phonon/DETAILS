Phonon wants to fill in the gap and provide a multimedia API for KDE
developers while at the same time giving the users more choices. With
Phonon applications don't need to develop sound engines as Phonon
provides them for free. Applications are written saying what they want
and not how they want to do it. This leaves some room for the
user/administrator to customize things.

After installing skim, you should also install at least an IMEngine (refer to a
 input method), such as scim-chinese (currently contains the Pinyin IMEngine 
for Simplified Chinese), scim-tables (contains table-based input methods, 
such as Wubi, Erbi for Simplified Chinese), scim-hangul (a popular Korean input 
method), scim-uim (contains a lot of Janpanese IMEngines) or scim-m17n 
(contains more than 30 input methods for various languages).

Before you can start to use the SCIM input method platform you have to configure 
your system correctly. Please read

cat << EOF
The OTPW package consists of the one-time-password generator otpw-gen plus
two verification routines otpw_prepare() and otpw_verify() that can easily
be added to programs such as login or ftpd on POSIX systems. For platforms
that support the Pluggable Authentication Method (PAM) interface, a suitable
wrapper is included as well. Login software extended this way will allow
reasonably secure user authentication over insecure network lines. The user
carries a password list on paper. The scheme is designed to be robust against
theft of the paper list and race-for-the-last-letter attacks. Cryptographic
hash values of the one-time passwords are stored for verification in the
userâ€™s home directory.

The pam_ccreds module provides the means for Linux workstations to
locally authenticate using an enterprise identity when the network
is unavailable. Used in conjunction with the nss_updatedb utility,
it provides a mechanism for disconnected use of network directories.
They are designed to work with pam_ldap and nss_ldap, also available
from PADL.

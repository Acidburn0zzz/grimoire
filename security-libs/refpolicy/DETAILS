The SELinux Reference Policy project (refpolicy) is a complete SELinux policy
that can be used as the system policy for a variety of systems and used as the
basis for creating other policies. Reference Policy was originally based on the
NSA example policy, but aims to accomplish many additional goals.

Reference Policy is under active development, with support and full time
development staff from Tresys Technology.

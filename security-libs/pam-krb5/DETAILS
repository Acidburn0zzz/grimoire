cat << EOF
pam-krb5 provides a Kerberos v5 PAM module that supports
authentication, user ticket cache handling, simple authorization (via
.k5login or checking Kerberos principals against local usernames), and
password changing. It can be configured through either options in the PAM
configuration itself or through entries in the system krb5.conf file,
and it tries to work around PAM implementation flaws in commonly-used
PAM-enabled applications such as OpenSSH and xdm.

This is not the Kerberos v5 PAM module maintained on Sourceforge and
used on Red Hat systems. It is an independent implementation that, if
it ever shared any common code, diverged long ago. It supports some
features that the Sourceforge module does not (particularly around
authorization), and does not support some options (particularly ones not
directly related to Kerberos v5) that it does. This module will never
support Kerberos v4 and will probably never directly support AFS (AFS
is probably better-supported via a dedicated AFS PAM module that can be
stacked with the Kerberos module of your choice). The main reason why I
use and maintain this module rather than the Sourceforge module is the
search_k5login feature, but I also believe the source code is cleaner
and easier to understand and maintain.

This module is based on the Kerberos PAM module by Frank Cusack, which in
turn was based on ideas taken from PAM modules written by Naomaru Itoi,
Curtis King, and Derrick Brashear. It incorporates improvements made to
the Debian version of the module by Sam Hartman and other fixes by Joel
Kociolek. The 1.1 and 1.2 releases were done by Andres Salomon. I took
over maintenance of this module as of 2.0 in order to incorporate many
additional fixes and improvements I was doing for Debian and to provide
a regular upstream distribution that could be used for the Heimdal module
in Debian and that we could use at Stanford for Red Hat and Solaris.

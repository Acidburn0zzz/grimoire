cat << EOF
paramiko is a module for python 2.2 (or higher) that implements the SSH2
protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote
machines. unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require heirarchical
certificates signed by a powerful central authority. you may know SSH2 as
the protocol that replaced telnet and rsh for secure access to remote 
shells, but the protocol also includes the ability to open arbitrary
channels to remote services across the encrypted tunnel (this is how
sftp works, for example).

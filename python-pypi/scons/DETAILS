SCons is a software construction tool (build tool substitute for Make)
implemented in Python. It features a modular build engine that can be embedded
in other software. SCons configuration files are Python scripts that call the
build engine API. It can scan files to detect dependencies automatically and
maintain a global view of all dependencies in a build tree, and uses MD5
signatures to detect changed file contents reliably. Timestamps can be used if
you prefer. SCons also supports parallel builds and is easily extensible
through user-defined builder and scanner objects.

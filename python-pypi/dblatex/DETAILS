DocBook to LaTeX Publishing that transforms your SGML/XML DocBook documents to
DVI, PostScript or PDF by translating them in pure LaTeX as a first process.
MathML 2.0 markups are supported, too. It originally started as a clone
of DB2LaTeX, but has been enhanced extensively since then and is actively
maintained by the upstream author.

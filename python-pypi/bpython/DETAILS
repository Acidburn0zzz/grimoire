cat << EOF
bpython is an enhanced Python interactive interpreter that uses curses and
provides the following main features: in-line syntax highlighting; readline-like
autocompletion with suggestions displayed as you type; expected argument
specification for functions; a handy pastebin function to quickly submit your
code and return a URL. Its goal is to bring together a few handy ideas to
enhance the standard interpreter without getting carried away.

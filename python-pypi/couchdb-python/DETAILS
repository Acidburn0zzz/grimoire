cat << EOF
This package currently encompasses four primary modules:
  couchdb.client: the basic client library

  couchdb.design: management of design documents

  couchdb.mapping: a higher-level API for mapping between CouchDB documents
  and Python objects

  couchdb.view: a CouchDB view server that allows writing view functions in
  Python

It also provides a couple of command-line tools:
  couchdb-dump: Writes a snapshot of a CouchDB database (including documents,
  attachments, and design documents) to MIME multipart file

  couchdb-load: Reads a MIME multipart file as generated by couchdb-dump and
  loads all the documents, attachments, and design documents into a CouchDB database.

  couchdb-replicate: Can be used as an update-notification script to trigger
  replication between databases when data is changed.

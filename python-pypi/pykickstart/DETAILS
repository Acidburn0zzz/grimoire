pykickstart is a python library that is used for reading and writing
kickstart files. It provides a common data representation, a parser, and a
writer. pykickstart is designed to be easy to use for developers. It is easy
to extend and embed in your own programs. The common data representation
helps to ensure that any utility using pykickstart can write out a complete
file, even if the utility doesn't understand all the kickstart options. The
main reason for creating this project was to synchronize kickstart support
between the two main programs - ["Anaconda"] and system-config-kickstart.

cat << EOF
ZSI, the Zolera SOAP Infrastructure, is a Python package that provides
an implementation of SOAP messaging, as described in The SOAP 1.1
Specification. In particular, ZSI parses and generates SOAP messages,
and converts between native Python datatypes and SOAP syntax. It can also
be used to build applications using SOAP Messages with Attachments. ZSI is
``transport neutral'', and provides only a simple I/O and dispatch framework;
a more complete solution is the responsibility of the application using
ZSI. As usage patterns emerge, and common application frameworks are more
understood, this may change.

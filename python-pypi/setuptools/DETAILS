setuptools is a collection of enhancements to the Python distutils (for Python
2.3 and up) that allow you to more easily build and distribute Python packages,
especially ones that have dependencies on other packages.

Packages built and distributed using setuptools look to the user like ordinary
Python packages based on the distutils. Your users don't need to install or
even know about setuptools in order to use them, and you don't have to include
the entire setuptools package in your distributions. By including just a single
bootstrap module (a 7K .py file), your package will automatically download and
install setuptools if the user is building your package from source and doesn't
have a suitable version already installed.

setuptools can be used to create Python Egg - a single-file importable
distribution format.

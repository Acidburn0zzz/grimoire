           SHORT="Command line removable volumes manager using HAL"
cat << EOF
halrv is a simple command line tool to manage removable volumes using HAL. It
aims to be the command line equivalent of many GUI programs that display a
list of removable drives in your computer, allow you to mount them by clicking
on their icon and, later, unmount and eject them (also called "safe removal").

With halrv, you can list removable volumes, mount a specific device, and
eject a specific device. It does not depend on any GUI libraries.

If present, the first argument to the program must be a known operation
name. Typing the full name is not needed, however, as long as the argument
provides a unique operation prefix. For example, the "mount" operation is the
only one startin with "m", so typing that single character is enough.Please

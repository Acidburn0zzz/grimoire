cat << EOF
This is an implementation of ASN.1 types and codecs in Python programming
language. It has been first written to support particular protocol (SNMP)
but then generalized to be suitable for a wide range of protocols
based on ASN.1 specification.

FEATURES
--------

* Generic implementation of ASN.1 types (X.208)
* Fully standard compliant BER/CER/DER codecs
* 100% Python, works with Python 1.5 and later
* MT-safe

MISFEATURES
-----------

* No ASN.1 compiler (by-hand ASN.1 spec compilation into Python code required)
* Codecs are not restartable

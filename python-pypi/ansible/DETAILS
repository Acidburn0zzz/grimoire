cat << EOF
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system.

It handles configuration-management, application deployment, cloud provisioning,
ad-hoc task-execution, and multinode orchestration - including trivializing
things like zero downtime rolling updates with load balancers.

Design principles:

* Have a dead simple setup process and a minimal learning curve
* Manage machines very quickly and in parallel
* Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by leveraging the
  existing SSH daemon
* Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human friendly
* Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content
* Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any software
* Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python
* Be usable as non-root
* Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.

cat << EOF
Alembic is a new database migrations tool, written by the author of SQLAlchemy. A 
migrations tool offers the following functionality:
Can emit ALTER statements to a database in order to change the structure of tables and 
other constructs
Provides a system whereby "migration scripts" may be constructed; each script indicates a 
particular series of steps that can "upgrade" a target database to a new version, and 
optionally a series of steps that can "downgrade" similarly, doing the same steps in 
reverse.
Allows the scripts to execute in some sequential manner.

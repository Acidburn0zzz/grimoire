cat << EOF
Cython is based on the well-known Pyrex, but supports more cutting edge 
functionality and optimizations.

The Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython 
additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on variables 
and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate very efficient C 
code from Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries, and for 
fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.

Python-GSSAPI is a Python binding to the Generic Security Service Application
Program Interface (GSSAPI). The GSSAPI provides a uniform interface to security
services which applications can use without having to worry about implementation
details of the underlying mechanisms. The most commonly used mechanism is
Kerberos v5, and this package provides an easy way to use Kerberos
authentication and security from Python code.

The GSSAPI version 2 is specified in RFC 2743 and the C language bindings which
this package is based on are specified in RFC 2744.

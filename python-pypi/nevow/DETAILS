Nevow is a Web application construction kit. It is designed to allow the
programmer to express as much of the view logic as desired in Python, and
includes a pure Python XML expression syntax, named stan, to facilitate
this. It also provides rich support for designer-edited templates, using
a very small XML attribute language to provide bi-directional template
manipulation capability.

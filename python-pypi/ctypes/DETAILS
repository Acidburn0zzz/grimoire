cat << EOF
ctypes is an advanced ffi (Foreign Function Interface) package for Python 2.3
and higher.

ctypes allows to call functions exposed from dlls/shared libraries and has
extensive facilities to create, access and manipulate simple and complicated C
data types in Python - in other words: wrap libraries in pure Python. It is
even possible to implement C callback functions in pure Python.

The Translate Toolkit is a set of software and documentation designed to help
make the lives of localizers both more productive and less frustrating.

The software includes programs to covert localization formats to the common PO,
and emerging XLIFF format. There are also programs to check and manage PO and
XLIFF files. Online documentation includes guides on using the tools, running a
localization project and how to localize various projects from OpenOffice.org to
Mozilla.

At its core the software contains a set of classes for handling various
localization storage formats: DTD, properties, OpenOffice.org GSI/SDF, CSV, MO,
Qt .ts, TMX, TBX, WordFast txt, Gettext .mo, Windows RC, and of course PO and
XLIFF. It also provides scripts to convert between these formats.

Also part of the Toolkit are Python programs to create word counts, merge
translations and perform various checks on translation files.

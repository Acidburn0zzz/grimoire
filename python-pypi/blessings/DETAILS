Blessings lifts several of curses’ limiting assumptions, and it makes your code
pretty, too:

* Use styles, color, and maybe a little positioning without necessarily clearing
  the whole screen first.
* Leave more than one screenful of scrollback in the buffer after your program
  exits, like a well-behaved command-line app should.
* Get rid of all those noisy, C-like calls to tigetstr and tparm, so your code
  doesn’t get crowded out by terminal bookkeeping.
* Act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a file, omitting the
  terminal control codes the user doesn’t want to see (optional).

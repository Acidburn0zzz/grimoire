Paste Deployment is a system for finding and configuring WSGI applications 
and servers. For WSGI application consumers it provides a single, simple 
function (loadapp) for loading a WSGI application from a configuration file 
or a Python Egg. For WSGI application providers it only asks for a single, 
simple entry point to your application, so that application users don't need to 
be exposed to the implementation details of your application.
The result is something a system administrator can install and manage without 
knowing any Python, or the details of the WSGI application or its container.

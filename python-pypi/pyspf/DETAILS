cat << EOF
SPF does email sender validation.  For more information about SPF, please
see http://www.openspf.org/

One incompatible change was introduced in version 1.7.  Prior to version 1.7,
connections from a local IP address (127...) would always return a Pass result.
The special case was eliminated.  Programs calling pySPF should not do SPF
checks on locally submitted mail.

This SPF client is intended to be installed on the border MTA, checking if
incoming SMTP clients are permitted to forward mail.  The SPF check should
be done during the MAIL FROM:<...> command.

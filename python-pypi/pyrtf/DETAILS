cat << EOF
 PyRTF is a set of python classes that make it possible to produce RTF
 documents from python programs. The library has no external dependancies and
 in my own testing has proved reliable and fast. Three examples are included
 in the release that demonstrate some of the features of the library, I'll
 be adding to these when I can.

 PyRTF has been tested on the following OS's; W2K, WinXP, GNU/Linux, OpenBSD,
 FreeBSD and on the following Word Processors; OpenOffice, Word95, Word97,
 Word2000, WordXP and MacWord (not sure which version).

TurboGears 2 is the built on top of the experience of several next generation
web
frameworks including TurboGears 1 (of course), Django, and Rails. All of
these frameworks
had limitations which were frustrating in various ways, and TG2 is an answer
to that
frustration. We wanted something that had:
Real multi-database support
Horizontal data partitioning (sharding)
Support for a variety of JavaScript toolkits, and new widget system to make
building ajax
heavy apps easier
Support for multiple data-exchange formats.
Built in extensibility via standard WSGI components

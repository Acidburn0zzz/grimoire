TurboGears 2 is the built on top of the experience of several next generation web 
frameworks including TurboGears 1 (of course), Django, and Rails. All of these frameworks 
had limitations which were frustrating in various ways, and TG2 is an answer to that 
frustration. We wanted something that had: 
Real multi-database support 
Horizontal data partitioning (sharding)
Support for a variety of JavaScript toolkits, and new widget system to make building ajax 
heavy apps easier
Support for multiple data-exchange formats.
Built in extensibility via standard WSGI components

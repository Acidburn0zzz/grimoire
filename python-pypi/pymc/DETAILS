Bayesian estimation, particularly using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
is an increasingly relevant approach to statistical estimation. However,
few statistical software packages implement MCMC samplers, and they are
non-trivial to code by hand. PyMC is a python module that implements a suite
of MCMC algorithms as python classes, and is extremely flexible and applicable
to a large suite of problems. PyMC includes methods for summarizing output,
plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence diagnostics.

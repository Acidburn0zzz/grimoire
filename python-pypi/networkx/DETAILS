NetworkX (NX) is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study
of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

Features:
  * Allows for 1M+ nodes, 10M+ edges
  * Includes standard graph-theoretic and statistical physics functions
  * Easy exchange of network algorithms between applications, disciplines,
  and platforms
  * Includes many classic graphs and synthetic networks
  * Nodes and edges can be "anything" (e.g. time-series, text, images,
  XML records)
  * Exploits existing code from high-quality legacy software in C, C++,
  Fortran, etc.
  * Open source (encourages community input)
  * Unit-tested

Additional benefits due to Python:
  * Allows fast prototyping of new algorithms
  * Easy to teach
  * Multi-platform
  * Allows easy access to almost any database

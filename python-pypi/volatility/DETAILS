cat << EOF
The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools, implemented
in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the extraction of digital
artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction techniques are
performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer
unprecedented visibilty into the runtime state of the system. The framework
is intended to introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated
with extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide
a platform for further work into this exciting area of research.

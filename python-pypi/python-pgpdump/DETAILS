pgpdump is a PGP packet parser library.

The intent here is not on completeness, as we donâ€™t currently decode every
packet type, but on being able to do what people actually have to 95% of the
time.

Currently supported things include:

* Signature packets
* Public key packets
* Secret key packets
* Trust, user ID, and user attribute packets
* ASCII-armor decoding and CRC check

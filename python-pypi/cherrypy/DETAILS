CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework.

CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way
they would build any other object-oriented Python program. This usually
results in smaller source code developed in less time.

CherryPy is now more than three years old and it is has proven very fast
and stable. It is being used in production by many sites, from the
simplest ones to the most demanding ones.

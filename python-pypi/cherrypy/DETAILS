CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework.

CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in much the same way they
would build any other object-oriented Python program. This usually results in
smaller source code developed in less time.

CherryPy is now more than three years old and it is has proven very fast and
stable. It is being used in production by many sites, from the simplest ones to
the most demanding ones.

cat << EOF
netaddr is a Python library for the manipulation of various common network
address notations and representations.

It takes the hassle out of fiddling with innumerable variations of network
addresses, presenting a consistent, extensible, easy-to-use and (above all)
Pythonic API.

Layer 3 addresses:
- IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, subnets, masks, prefixes
- iterating, slicing, sorting, summarizing and classifying IP networks
- dealing with various ranges formats (CIDR, arbitrary ranges and globs, nmap)
- set based operations (unions, intersections etc) over IP addresses and subnets
- parsing a large variety of different formats and notations
- looking up IANA IP block information
- generating DNS reverse lookups
- supernetting and subnetting

Layer 2 addresses:
- representation and manipulation MAC addresses and EUI-64 identifiers
- looking up IEEE organisational information (OUI, IAB)
- generating derived IPv6 addresses

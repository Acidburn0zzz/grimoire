Boodler is a tool for creating soundscapes -- continuous, infinitely varying
streams of sound. Boodler is designed to run in the background on a computer,
maintaining whatever sound environment you desire.

Boodler is extensible, customizable, and modular. Each soundscape is a
small piece of Python code -- typically less than a page. A soundscape can
incorporate other soundscapes; it can combine other soundscapes, switch
between them, fade them in and out. This package comes with many example
soundscapes. You can use these, modify them, combine them to arbitrary levels
of complexity, or write your own.

Note that a sound library is not included. A large collection of sounds
released under mixed licences (mostly free for non-commercial use) is
available from http://www.eblong.com/zarf/boodler/

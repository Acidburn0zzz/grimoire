cat << EOF
Provides a CAPTCHA for Python using the reCAPTCHA service. Does not require any
imaging libraries because the CAPTCHA is served directly from reCAPTCHA.

Also allows you to securely obfuscate emails with Mailhide. This functionality
requires pycrypto. This library requires two types of API keys.

If you'd like to use the CAPTCHA, you'll need a key from
https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create.

For Mailhide, you'll need a key from
http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/apikey.

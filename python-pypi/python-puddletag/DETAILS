puddletag is an audio tag editor (primarily created) for GNU/Linux similar
to the Windows program, Mp3tag. Unlike most taggers for GNU/Linux, it uses
a spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags you want to edit by hand are
visible and easily editable.

The usual tag editor features are supported like extracting tag information
from filenames, renaming files based on their tags by using patterns and
basic tag editing.

Then there’re Functions, which can do things like replace text, trim it,
do case conversions, etc. Actions can automate repetitive tasks. Doing web
lookups using Amazon (including cover art), Discogs (does cover art too!),
FreeDB and MusicBrainz is also supported. There’s quite a bit more, but
I’ve reached my comma quota.

Supported formats: ID3v1, ID3v2 (mp3), MP4 (mp4, m4a, etc.), VorbisComments
(ogg, flac), Musepack (mpc), Monkey’s Audio (.ape) and WavPack (wv).

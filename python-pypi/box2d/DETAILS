pybox2d is a 2D rigid body simulation library for games. Programmers can
use it in their games to make objects move in believable ways and make the
game world more interactive. From the game's point of view a physics engine
is just a system for procedural animation.

Box2D, the library behind pybox2d, is written in portable C++ and bound
to Python by SWIG. Most of the types defined in the engine begin with the
'''b2''' prefix. Hopefully this is sufficient to avoid name clashing with
your game engine if you choose to import it to your global namespace. It
also has a separate namespace that does away with these prefixes, if this
fits your coding style more (see Box2D.b2).

cat << EOF
The crecord mercurial extension allows you to interactively choose among the
changes you have made (with line-level granularity), and commit only those
changes you select.

After committing the selected changes, the unselected changes are still present
in your working copy, so you can use crecord multiple times to split large
changes into several smaller changesets.

BorgBackup (short: Borg) is a deduplicating backup program. Optionally, it supports 
compression and authenticated encryption.
The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to backup data. The 
data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable for daily backups since only 
changes are stored. The authenticated encryption technique makes it suitable for 
backups to not fully trusted targets.

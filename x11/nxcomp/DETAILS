The Xcomp library and nxproxy, a stand alone program wrapping the
functionalities built into the library, are the basic components you need
to compress the X protocol produced by any standard X client.

In its simplest configuration, a session is run on a remote server by having
a NX proxy listening to X traffic and compressing such traffic across a
TCP/IP connection to a proxy peer running on the local client. X traffic is
decompressed by the local proxy and forwarded to the X server.

The NX proxy makes use of "virtual display": the UNIX domain socket or the TCP
port acting as a display on the application server, where the X11 protocol
connection will be accepted and forwarded to the nxproxy peer running close
to the X server.

Besides compression of X protocol, nxproxy is able to tunnel SMB and multimedia
channels, so it is possible to listen to music from the remote terminal server
or make available local resources of the thin client to the remote session.

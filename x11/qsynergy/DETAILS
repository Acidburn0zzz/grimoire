QSynergy is a comprehensive and easy-to-use graphical front end for
Synergy. Synergy lets a user control more than one computer with a single mouse
and keyboard (and has lots and lots of extra features on top of that). Since
Synergy only has a GUI for MS Windows, QSynergy was written to step in and
fill this gap for users on Mac and Unix platforms.

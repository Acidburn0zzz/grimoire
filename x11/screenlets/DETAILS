Screenlets (short form of "Screen-Applets") are small owner-drawn applications
that can be described as "the virtual representation of things lying/standing
around on your desk": Sticknotes, clocks, rulers, ... the possibilities are
endless.

The goal of the Screenlets-framework is to simplify the creation of fully
themeable mini-apps that each solve basic desktop-work-related needs and
generally improve the usability and eye-candy of the modern Linux-desktop.

Screenlets strongly follow the UNIX-idea of modularization and having one
tool for one purpose. They are in some way the modern evolution of that
idea (ported from commandline-tools to desktop-apps). One intention of the
screenlets is to encourage creation of visually appealing graphical frontends
to common unix-tools to attract the "modern" user while still "keeping it
real".

Screenlets are in fact shaped Gtk-Windows that take care of drawing
themselves. They contain a window a menu and (optionally) a theme
(of type ScreenletTheme). Screenlets also offer a simple way of
handling/changing settings/options (for both - user and developer). Since
version 0.0.8 all screenlets can also be controlled over DBus and can easily
offer customized services.

xCHM is a .chm viewer for UNIX (Linux, *BSD, Solaris), written by 
Razvan Cojocaru. 
 Success stories of xCHM on Mac OS X have also been received, and 
apparently xCHM even works if compiled under the Cygwin environment in 
Windows.
 
 xCHM can show the contents tree if one is available, print the 
displayed page, change fonts faces and size, work with bookmarks, do 
the usual history stunts (forward, back, home), and seach for text in 
the whole book. The search is a fast B-tree search, based on the 
internal $FIftiMain file found inside indexed .chm archives, and it can 
be customized to search in content or just the topics' titles.

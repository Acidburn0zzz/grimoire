This software owes its name to Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep.
It realizes the collective dream of sleeping computers from all over the
internet.
When the screen-saver is activated, the screen goes black and an animated
'sheep' appears.
Behind the scenes, the screen-saver contacts a server and joins the parallel
computation of new sheep.
Every fifteen minutes 24/7 a new sheep is born and distributed to all clients
for display.
Each sheep is an animated fractal flame.
The Interpretation of Dreams contains an artistic, conceptual, and technical
explanation.

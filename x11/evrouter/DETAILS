cat << EOF
Evrouter reads events from the Linux input layer, and, based on a user-
specified set of rules, acts on them. Currently, evrouter can map events
to X11 key and button presses, XMMS commands, and can also run shell
commands.

Evrouter is intended to help legacy applications understand modern events
such as mouse wheel movement, special keys on keyboards etc. It also offers
hotkey-like functions, and can help existing modern applications deal with
events that, for one reason or another, X11 is unaware of (as long as they
are accessible through the Linux Event Layer).

XtermControl enables dynamic control of xterm properties. It makes it easy to
change the colors, title, font, and geometry of a running xterm, as well as to
report the current settings of the aforementioned properties. Window
manipulations de-/iconify, raise/lower and maximize/restore are also supported.
To complete the feature set, XtermControl lets advanced users issue any xterm
control sequence of their choosing.

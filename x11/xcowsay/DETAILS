xcowsay is a graphical configurable talking cow.  It's a GTK+ version of the
classic cowsay Perl script. It displays a cute pop-up cow on your desktop
with a speech bubble and some customizable text. It comes with a fortune(6)
wrapper script, xcowfortune, which you can cron to deliver periodic fortune
cookies via the cow. It even has a daemon mode that lets you send the cow's
messages over DBus.

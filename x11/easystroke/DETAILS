Gestures or strokes are movements that you make with you mouse (or your pen,
finger etc.) while holding down a specific mouse button. Easystroke will
execute certain actions if it recognizes the stroke; currently easystroke
can emulate key presses, execute shell commands, hold down modifiers and
emulate a scroll wheel. The program was designed with Tablet PCs in mind
and can be used effectively even without access to a keyboard. Easystroke
tries to provide an intuitive and efficient user interface, while at the
same time being highly configurable and offering many advanced features.

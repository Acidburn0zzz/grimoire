Sunclock displays a map of the Earth and shows which portion is illuminated
by the sun. It can commute between two states, the "clock window" and
the "map window". The clock window displays a small map of the Earth
and therefore occupies little space on the screen, while the "map window"
displays a large map and offers more advanced functions: local time
of cities, Sun and Moon position, etc.

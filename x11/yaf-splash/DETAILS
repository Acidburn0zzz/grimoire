yaf-splash pops up a window of text, auto-sized and centered on the screen,
that is dismissed when you click on it, rather like xmessage. Unlike xmessage,
it lacks buttons and other window manager cruft, can appear transparent via
the SHAPE extension, or overlays if your xserver supports them, and has a
bunch of other configuration options to tart it up with.

It also includes a clock with a countdown timer and a mirror mode to aid in
back projection, just to round out the feature bloat.

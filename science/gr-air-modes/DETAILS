gr-air-modes implements a software-defined radio receiver for Mode S
transponder signals, including ADS-B reports from equipped aircraft.

Mode S is the transponder protocol used in modern commercial aircraft.
A Mode S-equipped aircraft replies to radar interrogation by either ground
radar (secondary surveillance) or other aircraft ("Traffic Collision Avoidance
System", or TCAS). The protocol is an extended version of the Mode A/C protocol
used in transponders since the 1940s.  Mode S reports include a unique airframe
identifier (referred to as the "ICAO number") and altitude (to facilitate
separation control).  This receiver listens to the 1090MHz downlink channel;
interrogation requests at 1030MHz are not received or decoded by this program.

AVCE00 is an Open Source (i.e. Free!) ANSI-C library that makes Arc/Info
(binary) Vector Coverages appear as E00! It allows you to read and write
binary coverages just as if they were E00 files.

The C library can be easily plugged into existing E00 translators to add
support for binary coverages simply by replacing your existing translator's
read/write function by the AVCE00ReadNextLine() and AVCE00WriteNextLine()
functions provided by the library. See the library documentation for all
the details.

For those who do not need a library but simply want to convert some coverages,
the package includes the "AVCIMPORT" and "AVCEXPORT" conversion programs.

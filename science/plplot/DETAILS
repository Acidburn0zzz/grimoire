PLplot is a cross-platform software package for creating scientific plots. To
help accomplish that task it is organized as a core C library, language
bindings for that library, and device drivers which control how the plots
are presented in non-interactive and interactive plotting contexts.

The PLplot core library can be used to create standard x-y plots, semi-log
plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D surface plots, mesh plots, bar
charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)
may be placed on a single page, and multiple pages are allowed for those
device formats that support them.

PLplot has core support for Unicode. This means for our many Unicode-aware
devices that plots can be labelled using the enormous selection of Unicode
mathematical symbols. A large subset of our Unicode-aware devices also
support complex text layout (CTL) languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, and
Indic and Indic-derived CTL scripts such as Devanagari, Thai, Lao, and Tibetan.

cat << EOF
At its lowest level, HDF is a physical file format for storing scientific
data. At its highest level, HDF is a collection of utilities and applications
for manipulating, viewing, and analyzing data in HDF files. Between these
levels, HDF is a software library that provides high-level APIs and a
low-level data interface.  General Applications

At the highest level are HDF command-line utilities, The HDF Group applications
that support data visualization and analysis, and a variety of third-party
applications.  There are HDF command line utilities to:

convert from one format to another (for eg. to and from JPEG/HDF) analyze
and view HDF files (hdp being one of the more useful tools) manipulate HDF
files Please refer to the What Software uses HDF ? page for more information.

The Application Programming Interfaces

These include sets of routines for storing and accessing a specific type of
data. Although each interface (Application Programming Interface or API)
requires programming, all the low-level details can be ignored. These are
available in both C and Fortran.  The data structure types that HDF supports
are Scientific Data Sets (SD and DFSD APIs), Raster Images (General, 8-bit,
24-bit APIs), color palettes, text entries, and Vdatas and Vgroups.

The Low-level Interface

This interface is reserved for software developers. It was designed for direct
file I/O of data streams, error handling, memory management, and physical
storage. It is essentially a software toolkit for skilled programmers who
wish to make HDF do something more than what is currently available through
the higher-level interfaces. Low-level routines are only available in C.
The routines that make up the lower-level interface and the APIs are available
in the HDF Group's HDF libraries. The HDF utilities are included in The HDF
Group's HDF distribution. Applications supported by The HDF Group , as well
as applications contributed by members of the world-wide HDF user community
are freely available on The HDF Group's ftp server.

cat << EOF
GPSBabel converts waypoints, tracks, and routes between popular GPS receivers
and mapping programs. It also has powerful manipulation tools for such data.

By flattening the Tower of Babel that the authors of various programs for
manipulating GPS data have imposed upon us, it returns to us the ability
to freely move our own waypoint data between the programs and hardware we
choose to use.

It contains extensive data manipulation abilities making it a convenient
for server-side processing or as the backend for other tools.

It does not convert, transfer, send, or manipulate maps. We process data that
may (or may not be) placed on a map, such as waypoints, tracks, and routes.

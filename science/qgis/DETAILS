Quantum GIS (QGIS) is a cross-platform Geographic Information System
(GIS). It offers support for vector and raster formats, including spatially
enabled tables in PostgreSQL using PostGIS, common GIS vector formats
such as Shapefiles, and geo-referenced rasters (TIFF, PNG, and GEOTIFF).
Many plugins are available to dynamically add new functionality. Viewing
of GRASS layers (vector and raster) is provided by a plugin. GRASS vector
layers can be edited in QGIS.

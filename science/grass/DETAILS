GRASS (the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is a software raster-
and vector-based GIS (Geographic Information System), image processing system,
graphics production system, and spatial modeling system. It contains many
modules for raster data manipulation, vector data manipulation, rendering
images on the monitor or paper, multispectral image geocoding and processing,
point data management and general data management. It also has tools for
interfacing with digitizers, scanners, and the PostgreSQL, DBF, and ODBC
connected databases. GRASS operates on all common operating systems.

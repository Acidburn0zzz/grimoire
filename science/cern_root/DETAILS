The ROOT system provides a set of OO frameworks with all the functionality 
needed to handle and analyse large amounts of data in a very efficient way. 

Having the data defined as a set of objects, specialised storage methods 
are used to get direct access to the separate attributes of the selected 
objects, without having to touch the bulk of the data. Included are 
histograming methods in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, curve fitting, function 
evaluation, minimisation, graphics and visualization classes to allow the 
easy setup of an analysis system that can query and process the data 
interactively or in batch mode.

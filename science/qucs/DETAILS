cat << EOF
Qucs is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able to 
setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate the 
large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit. After 
that simulation has finished you can view the simulation results on a 
presentation page or window.

DC, AC, S-parameter, noise and transient analysis is possible, 
mathematical equations and use of a subcircuit hierarchy are available.

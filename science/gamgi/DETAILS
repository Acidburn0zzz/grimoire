GAMGI (General Atomistic Modelling Graphic Interface) is a program to build,
view, and analyze atomic strucures such as molecules, crystals, glasses,
liquids, etc. It aims to be useful for: the scientific community working in
Atomistic Modelling that needs a graphic interface to build input data and
to view and analyse output data, calculated with Ab-Initio and Molecular
Mechanics programs; the scientific community at large studying chemistry,
physics, materials science, geology, etc., that needs a graphic interface
to view and analyse atomic structural information and to prepare images for
presentations in classes and seminars; teaching chemistry and physics in
secondary schools and universities; science promotion in schools, exhibitions
and science museums.

cat << EOF
HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing
data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is designed for
flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data. HDF5 is
portable and is extensible, allowing applications to evolve in their use of
HDF5. The HDF5 Technology suite includes tools and applications for managing,
manipulating, viewing, and analyzing data in the HDF5 format.

The HDF5 technology suite includes:

A versatile data model that can represent very complex data objects and a
wide variety of metadata.  A completely portable file format with no limit
on the number or size of data objects in the collection.  A software library
that runs on a range of computational platforms, from laptops to massively
parallel systems, and implements a high-level API with C, C++, Fortran 90,
and Java interfaces.  A rich set of integrated performance features that allow
for access time and storage space optimizations.  Tools and applications for
managing, manipulating, viewing, and analyzing the data in the collection.
The HDF5 data model, file format, API, library, and tools are open and
distributed without charge.

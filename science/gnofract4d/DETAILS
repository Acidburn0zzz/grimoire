Gnofract 4D is a program which allows you to create beautiful mathematically-based images called fractals.

What sets it apart from other fractal programs (and makes it "4D") is the way that it treats the Mandelbrot and Julia sets as different views of the same four-dimensional fractal object. This allows you to create images which are a cross between the two sets and explore their inter-relationships.

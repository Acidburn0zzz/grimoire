Gnofract 4D is a program which allows you to create beautiful
mathematically-based images called fractals.

What sets it apart from other fractal programs (and makes it "4D") is the
way that it treats the Mandelbrot and Julia sets as different views of the
same four-dimensional fractal object. This allows you to create images which
are a cross between the two sets and explore their inter-relationships.

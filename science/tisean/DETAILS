cat << EOF
a software project for the analysis of time series with methods based on
the theory of nonlinear deterministic dynamical systems, or chaos theory,
if you prefer. The software has grown out of the work of our groups during
the last few years and was put into distributable form for the Winter School
on Nonlinear Time Series Analysis (TISEAN 98), held in Dresden, 11-21 Feb
1998. Some of the routines are built around the programs given in

H. Kantz and T. Schreiber, ``Nonlinear Time Series Analysis'', Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge (1997).

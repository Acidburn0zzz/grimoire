SciDAVis is a free interactive application aimed at data analysis and
publication-quality plotting. It combines a shallow learning curve and an
intuitive, easy-to-use graphical user interface with powerful features such
as scriptability and extensibility.

SciDAVis is similar in its field of application to proprietary Windows
applications like Origin and SigmaPlot as well as free applications like
QtiPlot, Labplot and Gnuplot.

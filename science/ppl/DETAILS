The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions especially
targeted at applications in the field of analysis and verification of
complex systems. These abstractions include convex polyhedra, defined
as the intersection of a finite number of (open or closed) halfspaces,
each described by a linear inequality (strict or non-strict) with rational
coefficients; some special classes of polyhedra shapes that offer interesting
complexity/precision tradeoffs; and grids which represent regularly spaced
points that satisfy a set of linear congruence relations. The library also
supports finite powersets and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and grids,
a mixed integer linear programming problem solver using an exact-arithmetic
version of the simplex algorithm, a parametric integer programming solver,
and primitives for the termination analysis via the automatic synthesis of
linear ranking functions.

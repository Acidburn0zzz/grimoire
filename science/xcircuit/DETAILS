XCircuit is a UNIX/X11 program for drawing publishable-quality electrical
circuit schematic diagrams and related figures, and produce circuit
netlists through schematic capture. XCircuit regards circuits as inherently
hierarchical, and writes both hierarchical PostScript output and hierarchical
SPICE netlists. Circuit components are saved in and retrieved from libraries
which are fully editable. XCircuit does not separate artistic expression
from circuit drawing; it maintains flexiblity in style without compromising
the power of schematic capture.

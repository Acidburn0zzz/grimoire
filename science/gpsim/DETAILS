gpsim is a full-featured software simulator for Microchip PIC
microcontrollers. gpsim has been designed to be as accurate as possible.
Accuracy includes the entire PIC - from the core to the I/O pins and including
ALL of the internal peripherals. Thus it's possible to create stimuli and
tie them to the I/O pins and test the PIC the same PIC the same way you would
in the real world.  gpsim has been designed to be as fast as possible. Real
time simulation speeds of 20Mhz pics are possible.

PCB is an interactive printed circuit board editor for the X11 window system.
PCB includes a rats nest feature, design rule checking, and can provide 
industry standard RS-274-X (Gerber), NC drill, and centroid data (X-Y data) 
output for use in the board fabrication and assembly process. PCB offers high 
end features such as an autorouter and trace optimizer which can tremendously 
reduce layout time.

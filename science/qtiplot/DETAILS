Scientists often need to use data analysis and plotting software. For Windows
systems there is a well known and widely used software called Origin, which
is not free, of course. The purpose of this project is to develop a free
(open source), platform independent alternative to Origin. QtiPlot is still
far from this goal, but there's a "wish to" list we are constantly working
on. All suggestions and contributions are most welcome!

Features:
* 3D Plots
* Publication quality 2D plots: Error Bars, Multilayer
  Plots, Bar Plots, Pie Plots, Vector Plots, Contour and Image Plots
* Statistical Plots: Box/Whiskers Diagramms, Histograms
* Easy export of plots to vector formats (EPS, PS, PDF) and to other various
  image formats (BMP, JPG, PNG, TIFF etc ...)
* Powerful and versatile spreadsheets and calculations in column-logic
* Easy ASCII-Import/Export of single or multiple files
* Linear and non-linear curve fitting with weighting and estimation of
  statistical errors of the fit-parameters, using Levenberg-Marquardt
  Least-Squares Algorithm or Nelder-Mead simplex minimization algorithm.
* Multi-peak fitting with Gaussian and Lorentzian peak profiles
* Data analysis: statistics, sorting, FFT, data smoothing (Savitzky-Golay,
  FFT smoothing, and moving window average), data filtering (low/high/band pass
  and band block filters), convolution/deconvolution, correlation,
  interpolation, numerical integration/differentiation, etc...
* Matrices optimized for 3D plotting
* Templates support: all the settings for plots (2D/3D), tables and matrixes can
  be saved to ASCII files and restored later on for a fast editing process
* Project files based on folders, a powerful project explorer with extensive
  built-in features: drag and drop, searching facilities, etc...

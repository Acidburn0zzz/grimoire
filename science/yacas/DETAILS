YACAS is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a program
for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. It uses its own
programming language designed for symbolic as well as arbitrary-precision
numerical computations. The system has a library of scripts that implement
many of the symbolic algebra operations; new algorithms can be easily added
to the library.  YACAS comes with extensive documentation (hundreds of pages)
covering the scripting language, the functionality that is already implemented
in the system, and the algorithms used.

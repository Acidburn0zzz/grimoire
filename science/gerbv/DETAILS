 Gerber Viewer (gerbv) is a viewer for Gerber files. Gerber files 
 are generated from PCB CAD system and sent to PCB manufacturers as 
 basis for the manufacturing process. The standard supported by gerbv 
 is RS-274X. The basic difference between RS-274D (the old standard) 
 and RS-274X is basically the addition of apertures in RS-274X. It 
 might be possible to make an RS-274X file out of an RS-274D file and 
 an aperture list. 
 
 gerbv also supports drill files. The format supported are known 
 under names as NC-drill or Excellon. The format is a bit undefined 
 and different EDA-vendors implement it different. But basically you 
 need to have the tools definition in the file, then the parser is 
 quite tolerant. The different holes are shown as dots in the (scaled) 
 correct size. 
 
 The different layers of the PCB are separated into different files. 
 gerbv can load all files at the same time and display them "on top 
 of each other". You can independently turn them on and off.

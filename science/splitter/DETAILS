The format used for Garmin maps has, in effect, a maximum size, meaning that
you have to split an .osm file that contains large well mapped regions into
a number of smaller tiles. This program does that. There are two stages of
processing required. The first stage is to calculate what area each tile
should cover, based on the distribution of nodes. The second stage writes
out the nodes, ways and relations from the original .osm file into separate
smaller .osm files, one for each area that was calculated in stage one.

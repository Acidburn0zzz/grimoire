R is "GNU S" - A language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics. R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was developed at
Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a wide variety of
statistical and graphical techniques (linear and nonlinear modelling,
statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, ...).

R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow constructions for
iteration and alternation, and it allows users to add additional functionality
by defining new functions. For computationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and
Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

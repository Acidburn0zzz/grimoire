File::Headerinfo is little more than a collection of wrappers around existing
modules like MP3::Info and Image::Size. It gathers them all behind a simple,
friendly interface and offers an easy way to get header information from
almost any kind of media file.

The main Headerinfo modules is a very simple factory class: the real work is
done by a set of dedicated subclasses each able to read a different sort of
file. A dispatch table in the factory class maps each file suffix onto the
subclass that can read that kind of file.

In normal use that minor complexity is hidden from view: all you have to do
is pass a file to the read() method and it will do the right thing.

cat << EOF
RecDescent incrementally generates top-down recursive-descent text
parsers from simple yacc-like grammar specifications.
It provides:

    * Regular expressions or literal strings as terminals (tokens)
    * Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule
    * Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within productions
    * Late-bound (run-time dispatched) subrules
    * Full access to Perl within actions specified as part of the grammar
    * Simple automated error reporting during parser generation and parsing
    * The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject particular
      productions during a parse
    * Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even during a parse)
    * Precompilation of parser objects
    * User-definable reduce-reduce conflict resolution via
      "scoring" of matching productions

See the file "RecDescent.pod" for excruciating detail on all of this.

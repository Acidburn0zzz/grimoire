This perl 5 library uses objects to create Web fill-out forms on the fly
and to parse their contents. It provides a simple interface for parsing
and interpreting query strings passed to CGI scripts. However, it also
offers a rich set of functions for creating fill-out forms. Instead of
remembering the syntax for HTML form elements, you just make a series of
perl function calls. An important fringe benefit of this is that the
value of the previous query is used to initialize the form, so that the
state of the form is preserved from invocation to invocation.

Everything is done through a ``CGI'' object. When you create one of these
objects it examines the environment for a query string, parses it, and
stores the results. You can then ask the CGI object to return or modify
the query values. CGI objects handle POST and GET methods correctly, and
correctly distinguish between scripts called from <ISINDEX> documents and
form-based documents. In fact you can debug your script from the command
line without worrying about setting up environment variables.

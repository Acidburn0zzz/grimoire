This module provides ways to parse XML documents. It is
built on top of the XML::Parser::Expat manpage, which is a
lower level interface to James Clark's expat library. Each
call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the doc­
ument.  Expat options may be provided when the XML::Parser
object is created.  These options are then passed on to
the Expat object on each parse call.  They can also be
given as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which
case they override options given at XML::Parser creation
time.

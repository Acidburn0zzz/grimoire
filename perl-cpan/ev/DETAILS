           SHORT="Perl interface to libev, a high performance full-featured event loop"
cat << EOF
This module provides an interface to libev. This module is very fast and
scalable. It is actually so fast that you can use it through the AnyEvent
module, stay portable to other event loops (if you don't rely on any watcher
types not available through it) and still be faster than with any other event
loop currently supported in Perl.

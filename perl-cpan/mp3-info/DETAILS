This is MP3::Info, for getting info out of and into MP3
files.

This release has some more bugfixes for extracting ID3v2
tags, including fixes for ID3v2.2.0, basic support for
ID3v2.4.0, and support for Unicode tags.  See the
documentation for more information.

A wrapper module is included so scripts calling
MPEG::MP3Info (the old name) will still work.

cat << EOF
Polymorphic return values are really useful. Often, we just want to know
if something worked or not. Other times, we'd like to know what the error
text was.  Still others, we may want to know what the error code was, and
what the error properties were. We don't want to handle objects or data
structures for every single return value, but we do want to check error
conditions in our code because that's what good programmers do.

When functions are successful they may return true, or perhaps some useful
data.  In the quest to provide consistent return values, this gets confusing
between complex, informational errors and successful return values.

This module provides these features with a simple API that should get you
what you're looking for in each contex a return value is used in.

The inc::latest module helps bootstrap configure-time dependencies for CPAN
distributions. These dependencies get bundled into the inc directory within
a distribution and are used by Makefile.PL or Build.PL.

Arguments to inc::latest are module names that are checked against both
the current @INC array and against specially-named directories in inc. If
the bundled version is newer than the installed one (or the module isn't
installed, then, the bundled directory is added to the start of @INC and
the module is loaded from there.

There are actually two variations of inc::latest -- one for authors and one
for the inc directory. For distribution authors, the inc::latest installed
in the system will record modules loaded via inc::latest and can be used
to create the bundled files in inc, including writing the second variation
as inc/latest.pm.

This second inc::latest is the one that is loaded in a distribution being
installed (e.g. from Makefile.PL or Build.PL). This bundled inc::latest is
the one that determines which module to load.

cat << EOF
Net::Daemon is an abstract base class for implementing portable server
applications in a very simple way.

It offers methods for the most common tasks a daemon needs: starting up,
logging, accepting clients, authorization, restricting its own environment for
security and doing the true work. You only have to override those methods that
aren't appropriate for you, but typically inheriting will safe you a lot of work
anyways.

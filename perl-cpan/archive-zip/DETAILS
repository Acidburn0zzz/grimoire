The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create,
manipulate, read, and write Zip archive files.

Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing
zip files. Once created, they can be written to files,
streams, or strings.

Members can be added, removed, extracted, replaced,
rearranged, and enumerated.  They can also be renamed or
have their dates, comments, or other attributes queried or
modified.  Their data can be compressed or uncompressed as
needed.  Members can be created from members in existing
Zip files, or from existing directories, files, or strings.

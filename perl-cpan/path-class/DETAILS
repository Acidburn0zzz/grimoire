cat << EOF
Path::Class is a module for manipulation of file and directory specifications
(strings describing their locations, like '/home/ken/foo.txt' or
'C:\Windows\Foo.txt') in a cross-platform manner. It supports pretty much
every platform Perl runs on, including Unix, Windows, Mac, VMS, Epoc, Cygwin,
OS/2, and NetWare.

The well-known module File::Spec also provides this service, but it's sort
of awkward to use well, so people sometimes avoid it, or use it in a way
that won't actually work properly on platforms significantly different than
the ones they've tested their code on.

In fact, Path::Class uses File::Spec internally, wrapping all the unsightly
details so you can concentrate on your application code.

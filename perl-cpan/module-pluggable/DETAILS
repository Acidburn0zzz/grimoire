cat << EOF
Provides a simple but, hopefully, extensible way of having 'plugins' for your
odule. Obviously this isn't going to be the be all and end all of solutions
but it works for me.

Essentially all it does is export a method into your namespace that looks
through a search path for .pm files and turn those into class names.

Optionally it instantiates those classes for you.

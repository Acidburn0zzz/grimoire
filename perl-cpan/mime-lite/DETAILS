cat << EOF
In the never-ending quest for great taste with fewer calories, we proudly
present: MIME::Lite.

MIME::Lite is intended as a simple, standalone module for generating (not
parsing!) MIME messages... specifically, it allows you to output a simple,
decent single- or multi-part message with text or binary attachments. It
does not require that you have the Mail:: or MIME:: modules installed,
but will work with them if they are.

You can specify each message part as either the literal data itself (in
a scalar or array), or as a string which can be given to open() to get a
readable filehandle (e.g., "<filename" or "somecommand|").

You don't need to worry about encoding your message data: this module will
do that for you. It handles the 5 standard MIME encodings.

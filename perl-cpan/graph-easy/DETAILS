This module lets you create graphs (nodes/vertices connected by edges/arcs,
not pie charts!) and then lay them out on a flat surface.

Once laid out, the graph can be converted into various output formats like
ASCII art, HTML or SVG. You can also output the graph in graphviz format
and let dot/neato/circo etc. do the layout for you.

Graphs can be either generated by Perl code, parsed from a simple text format
that is human readable and maintainable, or parsed from Graphviz code.

cat << EOF
File::RsyncP is a perl implementation of an Rsync client. It is compatible
with Rsync 2.5.5 - 2.6.3 (protocol versions 26-28). It can send or receive
files, either by running rsync on the remote machine, or connecting to an
rsyncd deamon on the remote machine.

What use is File::RsyncP? The main purpose is that File::RsyncP separates
all file system I/O into a separate module, which can be replaced by any
module of your own design. This allows rsync interfaces to non-filesystem
data types (eg: databases) to be developed with relative ease.

File::RsyncP was initially written to provide an Rsync interface for BackupPC,
http://backuppc.sourceforge.net. See BackupPC for programming examples.

File::RsyncP does not yet provide a command-line interface that mimics
native Rsync. Instead it provides an API that makes it possible to write
simple scripts that talk to rsync or rsyncd.

The File::RsyncP::FileIO module contains the default file system access
functions. File::RsyncP::FileIO may be subclassed or replaced by a custom
module to provide access to non-filesystem data types.

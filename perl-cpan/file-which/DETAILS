cat << EOF
File::Which searches the directories of the user's PATH (as returned by
File::Spec->path()), looking for executable files having the name specified
as a parameter to which(). Under Win32 systems, which do not have a notion
of directly executable files, but uses special extensions such as .exe and
.bat to identify them, File::Which takes extra steps to assure that you
will find the correct file (so for example, you might be searching for perl,
it'll try perl.exe, perl.bat, etc.)

cat << EOF
The basic task is to take some description of offered parameters and return
a hash ref with values for these parameters, influenced by the command line
and/or configuration files. The simple loop from many years ago now is about
the most comprehensive solution for a program's param space that I am aware
of, while still supporting the one-shot usage via a single function call
and a flat description of parameters.

It handles command line parameters (somewhat flexible regarding the number of
"-", but insisting on the equal sign in --name=value), defining and handling
standard parameters for generating helpful usage messages and parses as well
as generates configuration files.

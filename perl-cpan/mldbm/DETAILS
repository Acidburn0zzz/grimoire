This module can serve as a transparent interface to any TIEHASH package that is
required to store arbitrary perl data, including nested references. Thus, this
module can be used for storing references and other arbitrary data within DBM
databases.

It works by serializing the references in the hash into a single string. In the
underlying TIEHASH package (usually a DBM database), it is this string that gets
stored. When the value is fetched again, the string is deserialized to
reconstruct the data structure into memory.

cat << EOF
This class provides application developers with an abstraction class a level
away from DBI, that allows them to write an application that works on multiple
database platforms. The idea isn't to take away the responsibility for coding
different SQL on different platforms, but to simply provide a platform that
uses the right class at the right time for whatever DB is currently in use.

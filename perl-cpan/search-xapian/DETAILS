This module wraps most methods of most Xapian classes. The missing classes
and methods should be added in the future. It also provides a simplified,
more 'perlish' interface to some common operations, as demonstrated above.

There are some gaps in the POD documentation for wrapped
classes, but you can read the Xapian C++ API documentation at
http://xapian.org/docs/apidoc/html/annotated.html for details of these.
Alternatively, take a look at the code in the examples and tests.

If you want to use Search::Xapian and the threads module together, make sure
you're using Search::Xapian >= 1.0.4.0 and Perl >= 5.8.7. As of 1.0.4.0,
Search::Xapian uses CLONE_SKIP to make sure that the perl wrapper objects
aren't copied to new threads - without this the underlying C++ objects can
get destroyed more than once.

If you encounter problems, or have any comments, suggestions, patches, etc
please email the Xapian-discuss mailing list (details of which can be found
at http://xapian.org/lists).

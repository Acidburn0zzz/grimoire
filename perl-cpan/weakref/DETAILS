cat << EOF
A patch to Perl 5.005_55 by the author implements a core
API for weak references. This module is a Perl-level
interface to that API, allowing weak references to be
created in Perl.

A weak reference is just like an ordinary Perl reference
except that it isn't included in the reference count of the
thing referred to. This means that once all references to a
particular piece of data are weak, the piece of data is
freed and all the weak references are set to undef. This is
particularly useful for implementing circular data
structures without memory leaks or caches of objects.

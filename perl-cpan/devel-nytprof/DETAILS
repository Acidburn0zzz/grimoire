Devel::NYTProf is a powerful, fast, feature-rich perl source code profiler.

- Performs per-line statement profiling for fine detail - Performs
per-subroutine statement profiling for overview - Performs per-opcode profiling
for slow perl builtins - Performs per-block statement profiling (the first
profiler to do so) - Accounts correctly for time spent after calls return -
Performs inclusive and exclusive timing of subroutines - Subroutine times are
per calling location (a powerful feature) - Can profile compile-time activity,
just run-time, or just END time - Uses novel techniques for efficient profiling
- Sub-microsecond (100ns) resolution on supported systems - Very fast - the
fastest statement and subroutine profilers for perl - Handles applications
that fork, with no performance cost - Immune from noise caused by profiling
overheads and I/O - Program being profiled can stop/start the profiler -
Generates richly annotated and cross-linked html reports - Captures source
code, including string evals, for stable results - Trivial to use with
mod_perl - add one line to httpd.conf - Includes an extensive test suite -
Tested on very large codebases

NYTProf is effectively two profilers in one: a statement profiler, and a
subroutine profiler.

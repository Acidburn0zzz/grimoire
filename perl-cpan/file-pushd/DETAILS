File::pushd does a temporary chdir that is easily and automatically reverted,
similar to pushd in some Unix command shells. It works by creating an object
that caches the original working directory. When the object is destroyed,
the destructor calls chdir to revert to the original working directory. By
storing the object in a lexical variable with a limited scope, this happens
automatically at the end of the scope.

This is very handy when working with temporary directories for tasks like
testing; a function is provided to streamline getting a temporary directory
from File::Temp.

For convenience, the object stringifies as the canonical form of the absolute
pathname of the directory entered.

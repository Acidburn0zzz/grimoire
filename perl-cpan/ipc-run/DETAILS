cat << EOF
IPC::Run allows you run and interact with child processes using files, pipes,
and pseudo-ttys. Both system()-style and scripted usages are supported and may
be mixed. Likewise, functional and OO API styles are both supported and may be
mixed.
Various redirection operators reminiscent of those seen on common Unix and DOS
command lines are provided.

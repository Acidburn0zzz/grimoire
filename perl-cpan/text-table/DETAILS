cat << EOF
Organization of data in table form is a time-honored and useful method of data
representation. While columns of data are trivially generated by computer
through formatted output, even simple tasks like keeping titles aligned with
the data columns are not trivial, and the one-shot solutions one comes up with
tend to be particularly hard to maintain. Text::Table allows you to create and
maintain tables that adapt to alignment requirements as you use them.

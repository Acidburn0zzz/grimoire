cat << EOF
This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by invoking the appropriate
compilers and linkers in a cross-platform manner. It was motivated by the 
Module::Build project, but may be useful for other purposes as well. However, it
is not intended as a general cross-platform interface to all your C building 
needs. That would have been a much more ambitious goal!

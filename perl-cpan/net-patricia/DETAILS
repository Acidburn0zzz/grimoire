           SHORT="Patricia Trie perl module for fast IP address lookups"
cat << EOF
This module uses a Patricia Trie data structure to quickly perform IP address
prefix matching for applications such as IP subnet, network or routing
table lookups.  The data structure is based on a radix tree using a radix of
two, so sometimes you see patricia implementations called "radix" as well.
The term "Trie" is derived from the word "retrieval" but is pronounced like
"try".  Patricia stands for "Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information
Coded as Alphanumeric", and was first suggested for routing table lookups by
Van Jacobsen.  Patricia Trie performance characteristics are well-known as
it has been employed for routing table lookups within the BSD kernel since
the 4.3 Reno release.

The BSD radix code is thoroughly described in "TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2"
by Wright and Stevens and in the paper ``A Tree-Based Packet Routing Table
for Berkeley Unix'' by Keith Sklower.

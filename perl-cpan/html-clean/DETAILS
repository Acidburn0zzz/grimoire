The majority of the web pages of the internet today are much larger than
they need to be.  The reason for this is that HTML tends to be stored in a
human readable format, with indenting, newlines and comments.

However, all of these comments, whitespace etc. are ignored by the browser,
and needlessly lengthen download times.

Second, many people are using WYSIWYG HTML editors these days.  This makes
creating content easy.  However these editors can cause a number of
compatibility problems by tying themselves to a particular browser or
operating system.

Enter HTML::Clean.

The HTML::Clean module encapsulates a number of HTML optimizations and
cleanups.  The end result is HTML that loads faster, displays properly in
more browsers.  Think of it as a compiler that translates HTML input into
optimized machine readable code.

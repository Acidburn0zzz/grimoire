cat << EOF
An open source, completely automatic on-line backup system for UNIX.

* All backed up data is stored on the server in files on a filesystem
  -- no tape or archive devices are used
* The server is trusted only to make files available when they are
  required -- all data is encrypted
* A backup daemon runs on systems to be backed up, and copies encrypted
  data to the server when it notices changes
* Only changes within files are sent to the server, just like rsync * Old
versions of files on the server are stored as changes from the
  current version
* Behaves like tape -- old versions and deleted files are available * Choice
of backup behaviour, optimised for document or server backup * Designed to
be easy and cheap to run a server. Portable implementation,
  and RAID implemented in userland for reliability without complex server
  setup or expensive hardware. (optional)

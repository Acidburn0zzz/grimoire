The ntfs-3g driver is an open source, GPL licensed, third generation Linux
NTFS driver for 32-bit, little-endian architectures which was implemented
by the Linux-NTFS project. It provides full read-write access to NTFS,
excluding access to encrypted files, writing compressed files, changing
file ownership, access right.

Technically it's based on and a major improvement to the third generation
Linux NTFS driver, ntfsmount. The improvements includes functionality,
quality and performance enhancements.

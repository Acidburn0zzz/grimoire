           SHORT="The boot loader for Alpha SRM"
cat << EOF
This is one of the two boot loaders you might consider for you Alpha box
and _the_ one for booting from the SRM.
It is a good idea to read the instructions at the website (or stuff in
/usr/share/doc/aboot) carefully, though here is a quick reminder:
 - aboot needs an ext2/3 (or iso9660 on boot CD) filesystem and BSD
disklabels as partition scheme
 - It writes itself to the beginning of the disk - so keep 12MB free to
be on the safe side - other wise it might destroy your data!
 - <quick install instructions>
Note on the version: this is 0.9b with a patch from CLFS book that prevents
use of system kernel headers and makes it compile iwth gcc 4.1; there exists
a slighly newer base version 1.0_pre20040408 that may have some fixes probably
only relevant to Wildfire machines.

Netatalk is a freely-available, kernel level implementation of the AppleTalk 
Protocol Suite, originally for BSD-derived systems. A *NIX/*BSD system 
running netatalk is capable of serving many macintosh clients simultaneously 
as an AppleTalk router, AppleShare file server, *NIX/*BSD print server, 
and for accessing AppleTalk printers via Printer Access Protocol (PAP). 
Included are a number of minor printing and debugging utilities. Since 
full support requires AppleTalk to be compiled into your kernel, this 
release only sets up Apple filesharing over tcp/ip.

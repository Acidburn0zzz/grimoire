DeVeDe is a program to create video DVDs and CDs (VCD, sVCD or CVD), 
suitables for home players, from any number of video files, in any 
of the formats supported by Mplayer. The big advantage over other 
utilites is that it only needs Mplayer, Mencoder, DVDAuthor, 
VCDImager and MKisofs (well, and Python 2.4, PyGTK and PyGlade), 
so its dependencies are really small.

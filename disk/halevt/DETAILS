Halevt (HAL events manager) is a daemon that executes arbitrary commands
when a device with certain properties is added to the system and when device
properties change. Halevt uses HAL to monitor the state of your system's
hardware. With the default config file, it can handle the mounting of media
as they are inserted/attached to the system.

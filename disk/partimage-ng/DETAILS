Partimage-ng is a disk and partition imaging program. It allows you to create
exact images of single partitions or whole drives (including partition tables
so you don't need to recreate them manually). Partimage-ng does its job by
manipulating the low level filesystem structures and saving only the used
filesystem data blocks (sometimes referred to as clusters). Thus partimage-ng
needs to "understand" the layout of the filesystem it is trying to create an
image of. Currently it supports ext2, ext3, linux-swap, NTFS, and FAT32 (but
not FAT16) filesystems.

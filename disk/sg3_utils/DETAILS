cat << EOF
The sg3_utils package contains utilities that send SCSI commands to Linux
devices. As well as devices on SCSI transports (e.g. Fibre channel and the SCSI
parallel interface) many other devices use SCSI command sets. Examples are ATAPI
cd/dvd drives and SATA disks (typically via a translation layer or bridge
device). SCSI command sets are divided into what are called "primary" commands
(e.g. SPC-3) and device class specific sets (e.g. SBC-2 for disks and MMC-4 for
cd/dvd devices).  SCSI command sets and transports definitions can be found at
www.t10.org.

The sg3_utils package targets the linux kernel 2.4 and 2.6 series and is still
under active development. An earlier package called sg_utils targeted the linux
kernel 2.2 series with some support for the 2.0 series. See an earlier version
of this web page  for further information about sg_utils. This document
describes version 1.14 of sg3_utils .

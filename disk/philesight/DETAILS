Philesight is a tool to browse your filesystem and see where the diskspace is
being used at a glance. Philesight is implemented as a simple command line
program that generates PNG files; a wrapper CGI script is supplied to allow
navigating through the filesystem. Click the image on top for an online demo. 

Philesight is actually a clone of the filelight program. Wheres filelight is
ment as an interactive, user friendly application for the X-windows desktop,
philesight is designed to run on a remote server without graphical user
interface.

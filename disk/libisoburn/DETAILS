libisoburn is a frontend for libraries libburn and libisofs which enables
creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on all CD/DVD media supported
by libburn. This includes media like DVD+RW, which do not support multi-session
management on media level and even plain disk files or block devices.

There is a comand line and dialog application included: xorriso which allows to
use large parts of libisoburn's feature set.

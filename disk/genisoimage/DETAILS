Only install genisoimage from cdrkit. This is a replacement for mkisofs from
cdrtools. cdrkit is CD Recording Kit, a collection of applications related to
creation of optical disk media on Unix platforms. It is heavily based on the
cdrtools package (partially developed and maintained by Joerg Schilling before),
but is maintained independently.
This spell is mainly intended to provide a iso generation tool until the
libburnia project release its own tool named genisofs. During this time, this
spell can be used in conjunction with cdrkskin from the libburn-pykix spell.

Mindi Linux creates a set of boot/root floppy disk images that will let you
perform basic system maintenance on your Linux distro. The principal virtues
of Mindi's boot disks are the fact that they contain your kernel, modules,
tools and libraries. You can ask for additional binaries (or other files)
to be included on the kit. The libraries will be added for you.

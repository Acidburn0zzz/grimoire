Lilo is a Boot loader for Linux/x86 and other PC operating systems. Lilo is
responsible for loading your Linux kernel from either a floppy or a hard drive
and giving it control of the system. It can also be used to boot many other
operating sysetms, including the BSD variants, DOS, and OS/2. The Lilo
distribution includes full source, documentation and support files, but no
pre-compiled binaries. Lilo is capable of booting beyond cylinder 1024 of a hard
disk if the BIOS supports EDD packet call extensions to the int 0x13 interface.

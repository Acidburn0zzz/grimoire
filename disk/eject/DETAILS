Eject allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape, or 
JAZ or ZIP disk) to be ejected under software control. The command can 
also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject feature 
supported by some devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM drives.
Eject should work on any Linux system, although some functions are not 
available when running older kernels.

HOZ is what you would call a "file splitter". It's file format is the same
as the one used by the Hacha software, a well known splitter, specially
popular Spain and Latin America. HOZ is an fully compatible, faster, and
portable implementation of the Hacha format.

The name replaces the "S" in "Source" with a "Z" because "hoz" is "sickle"
in spanish, while "hacha" is the word for "axe".

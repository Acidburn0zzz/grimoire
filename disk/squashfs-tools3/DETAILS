Data, inodes and directories are compressed.

Squashfs stores full uid/gids (32 bits), and file creation time.

Files up to 2^32 bytes are supported. Filesystems can be up to 2^32 bytes.

Inode and directory data are highly compacted, and packed on byte
boundaries. Each compressed inode is on average 8 bytes in length (the exact
length varies on file type, i.e. regular file, directory, symbolic link, and
block/char device inodes have different sizes).

Squashfs can use block sizes up to 64K (the default size is 64K). Using 64K
blocks achieves greater compression ratios than the normal 4K block size.
File duplicates are detected and removed.

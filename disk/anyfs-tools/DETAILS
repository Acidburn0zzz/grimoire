cat << EOF
anyfs-tools provides a unix-like toolset for recovering and  converting
filesystems.  The following utils are included in the toolset:
  * build_it uses LINUX OS filesystem drivers to recursively read directory
    entries in order to obtain information  about  all  of  the  filesystem
    inodes.  The information is then saved to an external inode table.
  * anysurrect  searches  block  devices  for specific file types, based on
    their file structure.  Information  about each found file type is  also
    saved to an external inode table.
  * reblock  changes  the  filesystem block size.  reblock uses information
    from the filesystems inode table to change each files' fragments  plac-
    ing  so  that  it will align with block boundaries but with a new block
    size.
  * build_e2fs proceeds from external inode table information for  building
    ext2fs filesystems on device.
  * build_xfs  proceeds  from external inode table information for building
    xfs filesystems on device.
  * anyconvertfs converts device filesystem with applying other anyfs-tools
    utilities.

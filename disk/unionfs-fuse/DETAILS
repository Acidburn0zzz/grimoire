A Stackable Unification File System (UnionFS) in userland via FUSE

A stackable unification file system, which can appear to merge the contents of
several directories (branches), while keeping their physical content separate.
Unionfs is useful for unified source tree management, merged contents of split
CD-ROM, merged separate software package directories, data grids, and more.
Unionfs allows any mix of read-only and read-write branches, as well as
insertion and deletion of branches anywhere in the fan-out.

Why choose this:
  * The filesystem has to be mounted after the roots are mounted when using the
    standard module. With unionfs-fuse, you can mount the roots later and their
    contents will appear seamlesly
  * You get caching which speeds things up a lot for free
  * You get nice stats (optional)
  * Advanced features like copy-on-write and more

Why NOT choose this:
  * Compared to kernel-space solution we need lots of useless context switches
    which makes kernel-only solution clear speed-winner (well, actually I've
    made some tests and the hard-drives seem to be the bottleneck so the speed
    is fine, too)

           SHORT="Simple, unobtrusive network connections monitor applet for KDE"
cat << EOF
This is a small wrapper for netstat for KDE. It lives in system tray and shows
incoming/outgoing connections as popup messages (which don't steel focus from
active application), including IP addresses, ports and other. It also has flexible
black/white list to ignore some types of connections (WWW for example).

The following services are ignored by default:
* microsoft-ds 
* netbios-ssn 
* www

It was initially written for myself to monitor ssh, ftp and proxy activity on my
machine at work, but it also can monitor many other connection types.

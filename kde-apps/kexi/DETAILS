Kexi is an integrated environment for managing data. It helps creating database schemas, inserting, querying and processing data.

As Kexi is a real member of the KDE and KOffice projects, it integrates fluently into both. The report generation for instance is done by reusing the well known and well-tried Kugar report generator component of the KOffice suite, instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again.

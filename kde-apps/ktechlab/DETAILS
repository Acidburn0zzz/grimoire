cat << EOF
KTechlab provides a powerful environment for electronic circuits and
microcontrollers. This includes simulation of a variety of components
(logic, integrated, linear, nonlinear and reactive), simulation and
debugging of PIC microcontrollers via gpsim, and its own closely-linked
and complementary high level languages: FlowCode and Microbe.

It has also been designed to be as easy to use and unintrusive as
possible; all components and FlowParts have context sensitive help, and
simulating electronics is as simple as dragging components onto the
work area and creating connectors that autoroute themselves between
their pins. FlowCode allows users new to PICs to instantly create their
own programs, while the electronic simulation allows stepping through a
PIC's assembly program inside a circuit.

cat << EOF
KBarcode is a barcode and label printing application for KDE 3. It can be 
used to print every thing from simple business cards up to complex labels 
with several barcodes (e.g. article descriptions). 

KBarcode comes with an easy to use WYSIWYG label designer, a setup 
wizard, batch import of labels (directly from the delivery note), 
thousands of predefined labels, database managment tools and translations 
in many languages. Even printing more than 10.000 labels in one go is no 
problem for KBarcode. 

Additionally it is a simply xbarcode replacement for the creation of 
barcodes. All major types of barcodes like EAN, UPC, CODE39 and ISBN are 
supported.

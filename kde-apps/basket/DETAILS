This application provides as many baskets as you wish, and you
can drag and drop various objects (text, URLs, images, sounds...)
into them. 

Objects can be edited, copied, dragged... So, you can arrange them as
you want!

It's a DropDrawers clone (http://www.sigsoftware.com/dropdrawers/index.html)
for KDE 3.

Kopete is a flexible and extendable multiple protocol instant messaging
system designed as a plugin-based system. All protocols are plugins and
allow modular installment, configuration, and usage without the main
application knowing anything about the plugin being loaded. The goal of
Kopete is to provide users with a standard and easy to use interface
between all of their instant messaging systems, but at the same time
also providing developers with the ease of writing plugins to support a
new protocol. The core Kopete development team provides a handful of
plugins that most users can use, in addition to templates for new
developers to base a plugin off of.

Currently there is support for ICQ, AIM, MSN, Jabber and IRC.

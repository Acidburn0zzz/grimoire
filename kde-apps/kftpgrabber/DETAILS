cat << EOF
KFTPGrabber is a graphical FTP client for KDE. It was started in the year 2003,
because there was no good graphical clients for KDE and because many Linux
users still use Windows FTP clients (via Wine), since most Linux counterparts
lack some important features. So, this project tries to make a complete FTP
client solution with support for plugins, scripting and everything else the
users needs.

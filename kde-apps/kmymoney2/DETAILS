KMyMoney2 is specifically aimed at the typical home user at present.
Each account belongs to an institution and can be reconciled to balance your 
transactions. QIF import and export is supported within accounts so KMyMoney2
can read files exported from other programs and when downloaded from online
banking institutions. A search dialog is also provided to let the user find
transactions that match specific criteria.

Support for Categories and Payees are also provided allowing the user to input 
meaningful information, when entering transactions, and to provide a means for
future incarnations of KMyMoney2 to provide reporting and budgeting features.

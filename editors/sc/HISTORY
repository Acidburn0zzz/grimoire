	* INSTALL: Made directories beforehand to fix a staged install, since the
	Makefile doesn't check and make those automatically.
	* PRE_BUILD: Patched source with patch based on Debian's patch.  This fixes
	false syntax errors on all in-editor commands that rendered it useless.
	* BUILD: Moved sedit commands to PRE_BUILD.
	sc_7.16-2.diff: Patch based on Debian's megapatch to fix lex.c's syntax
	error problem, and to patch the Makefile with the correct directories for
	the FHS.

VBinDiff (Visual Binary Diff) displays files in hexadecimal and ASCII (or
EBCDIC). It can also display two files at once, and highlight the differences
between them. Unlike diff, it works well with large files (up to 4 GB).

VBinDiff was inspired by the Compare Files function of the ProSel utilities
by Glen Bredon, for the Apple II. When I couldn’t find a similar utility
for the PC, I wrote it myself.

The single-file mode was inspired by the LIST utility of 4DOS and
friends. While less provides a good line-oriented display, it has no
equivalent to LIST’s hex display. (True, you can pipe the file through
hexdump, but that’s incredibly inefficient on multi-gigabyte files.)

cat << EOF
This port of vi has generally preserved the original style, terminal
control, and feature set.  It adds support for international character
sets, including multibyte encodings such as UTF-8, and some minor
enhancements that were not present in BSD vi 3.7, but had been
included in later vi versions for System V or in POSIX.2.

Compared to most of its many clones, the traditional vi is a rather
small program (the binary size is approximately 160 kBytes on i386)
just with its extremely powerful editing interface, but lacking fancy
features like multiple undo, multiple screens, or syntax highlighting.

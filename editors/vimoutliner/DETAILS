VimOutliner is an outline processor with many of the same features as Grandview,
More, Thinktank, Ecco, etc. Features include tree expand/collapse, tree
promotion/demotion, level sensitive colors, interoutline linking, and body text.

What sets VimOutliner apart from the rest is that it's been constructed from the
ground up for fast and easy authoring.  Keystrokes are quick and easy,
especially for someone knowing the Vim editor. The mouse is completely
unnecessary (but is supported to the extent that Vim supports the mouse). Many
of the VimOutliner commands start with a double comma because that's very quick
to type.

All VimOutliner files have the ".otl" extension. For an overview of the
VimOutliner commands you can type ":h vo_cheatsheet" when you have opened an
otl file. For help on VimOutliner type ":h vo"

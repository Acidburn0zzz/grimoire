cat << EOF
dhex is a hex editor. It can be used to alter individual bytes in
large files. Since it is a text-mode programm based on ncurses, it
can run in numerous scenarios.  Its special feature is the diff
mode: With it, the user has a visual tool for file comparison. This
mode is invoked when dhex is called with two instead of one file as
parameters.

jackdmp is a C++ version of the Jack low-latency audio server for
multi-processor machines. It is a new implementation of the jack
server core features that aims in removing some limitations of the
current design. The activation system has been changed for a data
flow model and lock-free programming techniques for graph access
have been used to have a more dynamic and robust system.

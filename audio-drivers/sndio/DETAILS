Sndio is a small audio and MIDI framework part of the OpenBSD project and
ported to FreeBSD, Linux and NetBSD. It provides a lightweight audio & MIDI
server and a fully documented user-space API to access either the server or
directly the hardware in a uniform way. Sndio is designed to work for desktop
applications, but pays special attention to synchronization mechanisms and
reliability required by music applications. Reliability through simplicity
are part of the project goals.

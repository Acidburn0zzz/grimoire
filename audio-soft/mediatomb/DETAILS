MediaTomb is an open source (GPL) UPnP MediaServer with a nice web user interface,
it allows you to stream your digital media through your home network and
listen to/watch it on a variety of UPnP compatible devices.
MediaTomb implements the UPnP MediaServer V 1.0 specification that can be found on
http://www.upnp.org/. The current implementation focuses on parts that are required
by the specification, however we look into extending the functionality to cover the
optional parts of the spec as well.
MediaTomb should work with any UPnP compliant MediaRenderer, please tell us if you
experience difficulties with particular models, also take a look at the Supported
Devices list for more information.

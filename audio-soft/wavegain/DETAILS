WaveGain is an application of the ReplayGain algorithms to standard PCM wave
files. Where it differs from the other applications of this principle is that
the gain adjustments are applied directly to adjusting the scaling of the
samples. In other words, the option to write tags that can be read by other
applications to apply the gain adjustment does not exist, so the adjustments are
made directly to the data within the file.

Therefore, in the strictest meaning of the word, this process is NOT lossless.
However, with the application of dithering to the output, the losses can be
minimized and are, in any event, unlikely to be audible to the human ear.

So in simple terms, the program reads in wave files, analyses them, calculates
and displays recommended gain adjustments (track and album), and then applies
the adjustments directly to the wave data, if requested.

LASH is a session management system for JACK and ALSA audio applications 
on GNU/Linux. It is an implementation of a proposal that originated from 
this  discussion. Its aim is to allow you to have many different audio 
programs running at once, to save their setup, close them down and then 
easily reload the setup at some other time. LASH doesn't deal with any 
kind of audio data itself; it just runs programs, deals with 
saving/loading (arbitrary) data and connects different kinds of virtual 
audio ports together (currently JACK and ALSA sequencer ports). It can 
also be used to move entire sessions between computers, or post sessions 
on the Internet for download.

Spectral Modeling Synthesis
SMS is a set of techniques and software implementations for the 
analysis, transformation and synthesis of musical sounds. The aim of 
this work is to get general and musically meaningful sound 
representations based on analysis, from which musical parameters 
might be manipulated while maintaining high quality sound. These 
techniques can be used for synthesis, processing and coding 
applications, while some of the intermediate results might also be 
applied to other music related problems, such as sound source 
separation, musical acoustics, music perception, or performance 
analysis.

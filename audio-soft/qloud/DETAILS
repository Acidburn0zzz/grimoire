cat << EOF
QLoud is a tool to measure a loudspeaker frequency response.  Writing this
app is inspired by excellent applications written by Fons Adriaensen:
http://users.skynet.be/solaris/linuxaudio/
Theoretical background belongs to Angelo Farina:
http://pcfarina.eng.unipr.it/
In particular, this method was used:
http://pcfarina.eng.unipr.it/Public/Papers/134-AES00.PDF
Few hints: - move mouse above "?" sign at plot window and wait, - to delete
measurement, use context menu on mesurements table, - to see what the app
do, just connect app's JACK ports and try, - to see what your sound card
do, use loopback for line in/out, - using "very smooth" fractional octave
smoothing is hungry for CPU.
So be patient when select more rather 1/3 octave smoothing (1/3 octave and
less smoothing is rather interactive).

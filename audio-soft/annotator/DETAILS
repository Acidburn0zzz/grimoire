The CLAM Music Annotator is a GPL tool that can be used to visualize, check and modify music information extracted from audio: low level features, note 
segmentation, chords, structure... The tool is intended to be useful for the music information retrieval research whenever you need to:

    * Supervise and correct the results of automated audio feature extraction algorithms.
    * Generate manually edited annotations of audio as training examples or ground truth for those algorithms.

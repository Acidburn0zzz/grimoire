cat << EOF
cutmp3 is a small and fast command line MP3 editor.
It lets you select sections of an MP3 interactively or via a timetable
and save them to separate files without quality loss. 
It uses mpg123 for playback and works with VBR files and even with
files bigger than 2GB.
Other features are configurable silence seeking and ID3 tag seeking,
which are useful for concatenated mp3s.
...and if you don't want to cut them, you can also just query some
technical details about your mp3s (like the _real_ length of vbr files).

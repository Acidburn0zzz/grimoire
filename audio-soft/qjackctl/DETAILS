Qjackctl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server daemon, 
specific for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.

Written in C++ around the Qt3 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using Qt 
Designer.

Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon parameters, which 
are properly saved between sessions, and a way control of the status of the 
audio server daemon. With time, this primordial interface has become richer by 
including a enhanced patchbay and connection control features.

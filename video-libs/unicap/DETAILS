cat << EOF
unicap is a library to access different kinds of capture devices. Device drivers
are loaded with a plugin system so that new drivers can be easily added.
Currently, it has support for video-4-linux, video-4-linux-2, IIDC cameras, and
video-to-firewire converters, and provides GTK widgets for live video display
and access to device properties.

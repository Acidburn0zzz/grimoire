cat << EOF
unicap is a library to access different kinds of capture devices. Device
drivers are loaded with a plugin system so that new drivers can be easily
added. Currently, it has support for video-4-linux, video-4-linux-2, IIDC
cameras, and video-to-firewire converters, and provides GTK widgets for
live video display and access to device properties.

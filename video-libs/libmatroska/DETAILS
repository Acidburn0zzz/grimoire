matroska is a challenging project, aiming to become the standard of Multimedia
Container Formats one day. It was derived from a similar project called MCF,
but differentiates from that significantly because it is based on  EBML
(Extensible Binary Meta Language ), a kind of binary version of XML. This way
the development team gains significant advantages in terms of future format
extensability, without breaking file support in old parsers.

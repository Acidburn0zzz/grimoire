Gmerlin-avdecoder is a multimedia decoding library that supports audio, video,
and subtitles. It handles most commonly used media formats and codecs. The
streams can come from many sources including regular files, DVDs, VCDs,
and network connections using different protocols. For editing applications,
many formats can be decoded in a sample accurate mode, which provides fast
random access.

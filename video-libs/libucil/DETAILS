This is a part of unicap.

unicap is a library to access different kinds of (video) capture devices.

It uses a .so loading mechanism for the device layers so new device drivers can
easily be added.

unicap provides a simple yet flexible and powerfull API. The capture application
is able to access very different kinds of capture devices and set all of their
properties (such as brightness/contrast) without the exact knowledge of the
device.

Currently unicap provides support for IIDC cameras, video-4-linux,
video-4-linux-2 and video-to-firewire converters.

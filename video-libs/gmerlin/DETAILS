Gmerlin is a set of multimedia libraries which comes with several
applications. Applications include a full featured media player with Gtk-2
GUI, an audio/video transcoder, a webcam application, and an ALSA mixer. The
libraries provide many low-level functions like handling of uncompressed
A/V streams or decoding a wide range of multimedia formats. All libraries
were written with good reusability in mind, so you can easily write your
own applications based on gmerlin libraries.

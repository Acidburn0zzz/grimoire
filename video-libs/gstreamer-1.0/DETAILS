cat << EOF
This is GStreamer, a framework for streaming media.  The
fundamental design comes from the video pipeline at Oregon Graduate
Institute, as well as some ideas from DirectMedia.  It's based on
plug-ins that will provide the various codec and other functionality.
The  interface hopefully is generic enough for various companies (ahem,
Apple) to release binary codecs for Linux, until such time as they get
a clue and release the source.

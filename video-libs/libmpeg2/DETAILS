mpeg2dec is a test program for libmpeg2. It decodes mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 video streams, and also includes a demultiplexer for mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 program streams. It is purposely kept simple : it does not include features like reading files from a DVD, CSS, fullscreen output, navigation, etc... The main purpose of mpeg2dec is to have a simple test bed for libmpeg2.

The libmpeg2 source code is always distributed in the mpeg2dec package, to make it easier for people to test it.

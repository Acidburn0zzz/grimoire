cat << EOF
The purpose of this layer is to make it easy for application writers
to support a wide variety of devices without having to write separate
code for different devices in the same class. It consists of 3 different
libraries. libv4lconvert offers functions to convert from any (known) pixel
format to V4l2_PIX_FMT_BGR24 or V4l2_PIX_FMT_YUV420. libv4l1 offers the
(deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent of the drivers
for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many v4l2 drivers do
not). libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for
the application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.

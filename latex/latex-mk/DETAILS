LaTeX-Mk is a complete system for simplifying the management of small to large
sized LaTeX documents. LaTeX-Mk uses the standard make program for doing most
of the work. Users simply create a makefile which many times is as simple as
one line that specifies the document name and a single include line that loads
all of the LaTeX-Mk rules. LaTeX-Mk has been used for many years on projects
ranging in scale from a single page business letter to a published book.

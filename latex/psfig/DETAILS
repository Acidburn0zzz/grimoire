cat << EOF
Psfig/tex uses \special calls to manipulate the PostScript environment
within a document, and include figure files. To use psfig, you must
therefore be using a postscript device for your output. This version
of psfig/tex works with the unix "dvips" PostScript driver, which is
available from labrea.stanford.edu, and with OzTeX.
The current ‘preferred’ solution is the LaTeX graphicx package, but the
graphics bundle does contain a version of epsfig for use with current LaTeX.
